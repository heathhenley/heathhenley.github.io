Arpaci-Dusseau and Andrea C. Arpaci-Dusseau</p><p>This is the quintessential OS book that&rsquo;s widely recommended and used for many
OS courses. I realized I had never picked it up - and given that my path to SWE
was a bit un-conventional, I still have a lot of gaps - this was a great way to
fill them in, clear some things up and reinforce things I&rsquo;ve forgotten long ago.</p><p>It&rsquo;s not too low level, but it&rsquo;s got a lot references to jump off from to dig
deeper as needed.</p><p>These are scattered notes from reading the book - level of detail varies depending on how interesting I found the topic, how much I already knew, and how much I felt like taking notes at that time.</p><h2 id=part-1---virtualization>Part 1 - Virtualization</h2><p>The virtualization layers over the actual hardware</p><h3 id=cpu-virtualization>CPU Virtualization</h3><p>Process and process api - kind of an introduction</p><ul><li>Fork/exec to create process</li><li>Kernel vs user mode</li><li>System calls, sensitive stuff, mem reads etc all in kernel mode</li><li>How the CPU allows processes to run arbitrary code, but keeps control</li><li>TRAP table loaded at boot time with all system calls - so no one can mess with it</li></ul><p>Context switching</p><ul><li>Interrupts periodically or io (needs system call) CPU decides whether to context switch or not</li><li>Load instructions / registers / current pointer from memory</li></ul><p>Scheduling methods</p><ul><li>Simple Impractical - round robin, shortest first, shortest to complete first, etc</li><li>Optimize turnaround time - the time between getting queued and completing</li><li>Optimize response time - the time between getting queued and first being scheduled</li><li>Actually used in some form - Multi Level Feedback Queue</li></ul><p>Multi-level feedback queue</p><ul><li>Multiple queues (high priority to low priority)</li><li>Jobs in highest run before jobs in any lower queues</li><li>If they have the same priority they run in round robin</li><li>All processes start with highest priority</li><li>As they use “allotments” they are moved down</li><li>All processes moved up to highest sometimes</li></ul><p>More scheduling: proportional share</p><ul><li>Optimize “fairness”</li><li>Lottery - user assigns tickets to convey priority, processes randomly selected based on tickets to run —> not obvious how to assign, for shirt running processes not always very “fair”, random</li><li>Stride - deterministic version but similar to lottery, needs some extra state and to handle adding in new processes in a special way</li><li>“Completely fair scheduler” - CFS - as process runs it accumulates virtual runtime, always run the process with the lowest virtual runtime - priority can be adjusted using nice</li><li>CFS - store running processes in a red black tree for search, insert, remove trade off</li><li>CFS - processes that sleep frequently might never get their fair share of runtime, when it wakes up it’s runtime is set to the lowest value in the rb tree (so it won’t be very behind and starve the other processes until catching up)</li><li>Maybe not as good for user systems, but good for something like a data center</li><li>“Nice” ness controls priority on Linux based systems</li></ul><p>Scheduling with multiple cpus</p><ul><li>Caching</li><li>Cache coherence in concurrent systems is a problem - “bus snooping” one option, caches watch changes and if a value they have is updated, they invalidate or refetch</li><li>Cache affinity - if a process has previously run on a CPU, it should run on that one again if possible because some of the state / data it needs might will likely already be in the programs cache</li><li>Single Q scheduler- reuse the framework for a single CPU - instead of next job grab next n jobs. Biggest issue is cache affinity, jobs will flip plop around and run on different processors, but can be handled by modifying algorithm to account for affinity. Synchronization also introduces overhead, they need to lock to access the shared queue</li><li>Multi Q scheduler - each CPU with its own queue and jobs assigned randomly or by some heuristic.

translation - Extra memory load for each existing load (to load the page table entry) - so without hardware or other trick would be too slow</li><li>Problem - size - Page table would also be too big, wasting memory on page table instead of programs - 64bit sys would be yuge</li></ul></li></ul><p>Paging - making address translations faster</p><ul><li><strong>TLB</strong>- <strong>translation-look aside buffer</strong> - really it’s an address translation cache</li><li>Hardware cache in the MMU for common translations - hardware checks the TLB before going to the page table to get the page table entry, way faster</li><li>Bigger page size is better for cache hits</li><li>Temporal and spatial locality benefits - array elements etc stored near each other (chunks on same page) (spatial) - re-accessing data (temporal)</li><li>TLB misses can be handled by hardware (CISC) or using software (RISC) - software is more flexible because page table can be any data structure - need to avoid triggering infinite recursion if the trap handler code for cache misses is in a virtual address not in TLB (sometimes translation is in there permanently etc to fix this, or handler code is permanently located in unmapped memory that doesn’t need a translation)</li><li>TLB content is process dependent (actively running processes) - need to handle context switching<ul><li>Could flush it all on context switches - works but cost could be high, lots of misses</li><li>Can add an <strong>address space identifier</strong> (ASID) to the TLB entry - on context switch a privileged register is set to the ASID of the running process (like PID but fewer bits)</li><li>Cache replacement policies - LRU - good but has poorly performing edge cases, eg always reading in increments of n+1 where n is the TLB size (miss every time) - random access doesn’t have this issue but doesn’t benefit from locality</li><li>if the number of pages a program uses in a short period of time are larger than the TLB, there is a performance hit - <strong>cache coverage</strong> —> dbms like pg, can benefit from support for increasing page size</li></ul></li></ul><p>Paging - making page table smaller
An array / linear page table is too large (there’s one for each process) - what can we do about it?</p><ul><li>One approach: Combine segmentation with paging - instead of mapping the entire address space with the page table, which will be sparse usually, instead create page tables for the stack, heap, code, segments. Each process will have three page tables. Two bits at the start of the virtual address used to denote segment so on a TLB miss the correct page table can but used. In this case - Base and bounds in the MMU don’t refer to base physical address of segment and limit, but now they refer to the physical address of the page table for that segment and its limit (how many pages it has)<ul><li>Way less space used for page table for most processes</li><li>Reintroducing segmentation issues (fragmentation) - need to store / fit the page tables in memory</li><li>Program with a large heap etc still going to have a big page table</li></ul></li><li>Another approach - <strong>Multilevel page table</strong> - avoid all the invalid regions, try not to introduce frag. Split the page table into pages and introduce a <strong>Page Directory</strong> to track where each page of the page table is, or if that has no valid data (so doesn’t need to be represented in the page table). Virtual address top bits index into the page directory, then into page table and then offset<ul><li>Way more space efficient</li><li>Used in modern systems</li><li>Space time tradeoff - less space but another layer of indirection so if there’s a TLB miss another read is needed to find the page in the page table, and then use the entry to translate the address</li></ul></li><li>More levels can be added - not enough, same idea though - page directory then split into pages, managed by another page directory</li><li>Another approach - <strong>inverted page table</strong> - one single page table that represents pages of physical memory, entries contain info about which processs is using it</li></ul><p>Beyond physical memory: mechanisms</p><ul><li>Whole processes (or multiple processes) can’t fit in physical memory at once</li><li>Want to support but stay behind the seems to the programmer</li><li>Introduce a larger slower storage device (hard drive, ssd etc) to use to extend memory</li><li>Save some space on the disk to use for swapping out pages <strong>swap space</strong><ul><li>Swap space size ultimately determines the number of pages that can be in use by the system at a time</li></ul></li><li>OS needs to remember <strong>disk address</strong> of pages</li><li>A <strong>present bit</strong> is added to the PTE to represent whether the page is in physical memory or not. If it is not, it raises a <strong>page fault</strong> and runs a page fault handler</li><li>When the page isn’t in physical memory, address in the pte is disk location - handler looks it up, disk io to fetch, swap into physical memory and update the PTE with location in physical memory (page frame number)</li><li>Blocking on I/O convenient time for processes to run</li><li>If no space in physical memory, must swap out pages - <strong>page replacement policy</strong></li><li>OS doesn’t wait for the disk to be full - <strong>high watermark</strong> and <strong>low watermark</strong> - when there are fewer than low watermark free pages in physical memory, a <strong>page daemon</strong> runs and swaps out pages until there are spots for high watermark pages</li><li>Clustering or grouping pages to swap is more efficient</li><li>Daemon is based maxwells demon! (Ref on page 255)</li></ul><p>Beyond physical memory: policies (replacement)</p><ul><li>When there is memory pressure (not a lot of free memory) - and page faults, OS must decide which pages to evict from memory to swap the pages it needs in from disk.</li><li>Looking for optimal <strong>replacement policy</strong> to minimize misses / page faults</li><li>Optimal strategy (can’t be implemented practically) - used to compare to other algorithms- evict the page that will be used furthest in the future</li><li>Simple Strategy: FIFO - simple but performance not good</li><li>Simple Strategy: Random - simple but, well, random - sometimes as good as optimal sometimes much worse</li><li>LRU - using history - base it on locality, either using frequency or recency to rank pages, replacing the least</li><li>Workload examples - LRU is generally better when the workload has locality</li><li>Implementing LRU - it would be expensive to find the actual least recently used page, instead it’s approximated<ul><li>A <strong>use bit</strong> is set to one whenever a page is used (can be in the page table or array) by the hardware</li><li>OS can employ the use bit to approximate LRU in different ways - one way is the <strong>clock algorithm</strong><ul><li>Point at some particular page to begin with, when a replacement must happen, checks the use bit of the page it’s pointed at. If it’s 0 replace, if it’s one, set to zero and move to the next</li><li>Dirty pages (modified) are more expensive to evict due to the disk io, a common modification is to prefer clean and unused pages to replace first, then dirty but unused</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Bringing pages in to memory - <strong>page selection</strong><ul><li>Demand paging - bring it in when accessed</li><li>Prefetching - bring in when it’s likely to be used</li></ul></li><li>Thrashing - continuously paging</li><li>Admission control - when memory is tight OS might decide not to run a subset of processes to let the existing processes run better<ul><li>“Sometimes better to do less work well than to try to do everything at once poorly”</li></ul></li></ul><p>Building a complete virtual memory system
Extra things that should be consider when everything is put together</p><ul><li>VAX system - 70’s but many ideas still used<ul><li>No reference bit in page table to determine which pages in use - make all as inaccessible, track which ones trap - those are being used currently, put back their normal permissions</li><li>They were worried about “memory hogs” - processes that use a lot of memory so physical memory with pages they need, introduced <strong>segmented FIFO</strong> instead - each process has a FIFO list and limit on how many pages it can keep in memory, evicts oldest<ul><li>Performance not good: <strong>second chance</strong> lists - when evicted the page moved to a secondary list (one dirty one clean) - if a page needed by another process, can remove one from clean list and load the page it needs. If the original process needs it again before that happens, it reclaims it from the free / dirt lost - so saving what would have been disk io</li></ul></li><li><strong>Demand zeroing</strong> - need to zero memory out so a process can’t read what was there before - instead of doing it on alloc, OS will basically wait and zero out what is needed on demand</li><li><strong>Copy-on-write</strong> - whenever the OS needs to copy a page from one address space to another, it maps it into the new processes address space and marks them both as read only, if never written, it never actually needs to copy</li></ul></li><li>Linux VM system - still going of course!<ul><li>similar virtual address space split - new thing is logical vs virtual kernel memory - logical section of kernel memory is contiguous and maps to physical memory directly, which is useful for <strong>direct memory access</strong> (fam) for device integration</li><li>multilevel page table and supports many page sizes</li><li>page cache - uses <strong>2Q</strong> replacement instead of normal LRU to handle the case with a cyclic large file is read (would wipe out the whole cache normally) - inactive list and active list - pages first go into the inactive list, if they’re used again they going into the active list - replacement takes from the inactive list. Similar performance to LRU but handles the worst case better.</li><li>Security<ul><li>Buffer overflow exploits</li><li><strong>Return oriented programming</strong> —> address space randomization makes this very difficult</li><li><strong>Meltdown and Spectre</strong> - showed that CPU speculative execution could be exploited. Move most of kernel address space out of process address space )stopped mapping it in) expect for the bare minimum - but then requires page table switch so it’s a performance hit in exchange for security</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h2 id=part-2-concurrency>Part 2: Concurrency</h2><p>Introduction + interlude</p><ul><li>multithreading - sharing address space - need to sync</li><li>we need synchronization primatives to avoid race conditions, etc - how does the hardware support that?<ul><li>thread api review

binary semaphore (only two states) - init value important - “number of resources available” - eg for a lock it’s 1, thread will call wait, decrement, and keep going if no other thread called, then when it’s done increase back to 1 on post - if another calls in critical sections, it will drop to -1 and the caller will wait</li><li>use for ordering - like a condition var - can init to 0, so wait will block (for instance in a main thread) until something is done and a post is called in a worker thread, for example</li><li>producer consumer- use a full and empty semaphore to sync -

Sequential read and write - (n-1) x disk value - the parity disk becomes a bottleneck, “small write problem” - even though writes can happen in parallel, they’re serialized because they all need to update the parity disk, so random write performance is bad - half the disk value (half because each update is a read and a write), doesn’t scale with more disks</li><li>RAID 5 is just like 4 but the parity data for a stripe is rotated through all the disks - better random write throughput because it can be parallelized and now scales with number of disks - basically has completely replaced level 4 except in very specific cases where the simplicity is important and / or workload is such that they don’t care about the small write problem</li><li>Page 489 has a good table with throughputs of all and how they scale</li><li>Consistent Update Problem - need to update multiple disks ideally atomically, in case of failure, in practice something like a WAL is used to record what is about to happen, and can be used to replay / recover</li></ul><p>Interlude: files and directories

Files become fragmented over time because of his free space is managed. Also reading an inode and then going to the data (which happens all the time) causes a seek.

The system could lose power or crash at any time, maintaining the file system offense requires multiple writes - need to deal with or avoid inconsistent states if the system crashes between two operations. Original way of dealing with it was using <strong>fsck</strong> - now it’s more common to use <strong>journaling (write ahead logging).</strong></p><p>fsck - look for inconsistency after the fact and clean them up, would run before a disk was mounted - required intimate knowledge of the file system to be able to check everything. Biggest issue though was slowness - scanning the whole disk to check for inconsistencies, build the real data bitmap to compare to the disk one, etc, takes a while as disks get larger. Needed another option…</p><p>journaling / WAL - before doing any operation write them to a log in a different location - more work for updates / writes but much less work to recover (you know exactly what to check). Same idea used in databases. Rough idea of how it works:</p><ul><li>Write transaction to log (separate partition maybe even separate device)</li><li>It has: tax start marker, blocks from, blocks to, tx end marker - physical logging, eg it literally has all the data the data we’re using.</li><li>Once log is written system is “checkpointed” up by carrying out the transaction - if it completes successfully it’s up to date.
What happens if the system crashes while writing the WAL entry though? Need a way to: make sure that no bad transaction can get written to the log (and look good) - but also don’t want it to be too slow.
Steps:</li><li><strong>journal write</strong> - write everything for the current journal entry except for the transaction end, wait for the writes to complete</li><li><strong>journal commit</strong> - once the write is confirmed, then write a single 512 byte block transaction end, wait for it to complete - write is “committed”</li><li><strong>checkpoint</strong> - actually carry out the transaction</li><li><strong>free</strong> - update (journal superblock) to track the lost recent and oldest uncommitted tx (or none of all complete) so the space can be used again
The blocking part of this (waiting for the entry to be written before committing) can be fixed by introducing a checksum and allowing the log entry to write all at the same time as a usual write - this is used in ext4</li></ul><p>Recovery - on startup, replay any committed transactions that haven’t been applied - disk will be in a consistent state and can be mounted.</p><p>Full data journaling - we now have a way to recover but must write the data twice for each write (writing to the log and then to the location on disk). Another approach - <strong>metadata journaling</strong> - write everything to the log except the actual data blocks, write them to their home. Only difference- need to wait for the data blocks and the journal entry to be complete before ”committing” by writing the transaction end block.</p><p>Windows NTFS, SGI’s XFS both use metadata journaling - ext3 has data journaling or metadata journaling modes available as an option.</p><p>Summary: fsck too slow to actually recover, ordered metadata journaling is the most common way to provide reasonable integrity but without requiring the extra write that data journaling does.</p><p>Other ideas exist - log centered file system, adding back pointers to data-blocks so that it’s easier to check consistency (point back to the inode it belongs to, etc), “soft updates” - order writes in way that nothing is ever inconsistent- really difficult to implement because it needs to know a lot about the actual file system. Finally <strong>copy-on-write</strong> - not actually updating any of the structures, instead write somewhere else, and when all completed, update the pointers etc.</p><p><strong>Log Structured File Systems</strong>
A file system developed at Berkeley- based on observations:</p><ul><li>as memory increases, more data can fit in cache - so performance is mostly determined by write performance</li><li>sequential I/O on disk way more performant than random (seek and rotation delays)</li><li>existing file systems were performing poorly on common workloads - create a small file, for ex - with FFS is updating inode bitmap, data bitmap, creating the inode, creating the data block, update directory that holds the file</li><li>not raid aware
LFS buffers all writes in an in memory segment - and when it’s full writes the whole segment sequentially.</li><li>how much to buffer? Depends on the trade between transfer time and positioning time - each individual write will have a cost to get to the right position - transfer time is constant - so need to group enough together that positioning doesn’t dominate
How do you find inodes? (They’re just dumped sequentially with the data blocks)</li><li>introduce an imap - map to where the most recent version of an inode is on the disk, but the imap itself is also spread out and dumped with the data and inode info in the segment</li><li>add checkpoint region, that points to the locations of imap chunks - in a fixed location</li></ul><p>Directories are basically the same as classic structure (inode, name mapping)</p><ul><li>using imap to track locations of inodes helps - if it was the location, when a file was updated, its location would change (no in place overwriting in LFS) - the directory that pointed to it would need to update too, and so on (<strong>recursive update problem</strong>)</li></ul><p>Garbage collection</p><ul><li>in this system - each update writes the inode and updated data again - leaving the old versions of the data on disk but not “live”</li><li>can actually keep - <strong>versioning file system</strong> - read about later</li><li>LFS reads a bunch of partially used segments, determines what is still live and what is garbage, and then cleans up / compacts into fewer segments - freeing up space for more writing</li><li>whether a block is alive?<ul><li>add a <strong>segment summary</strong> block to the segment - which file each block in the segment belongs to and which in the file it is</li><li>can use with imap - look up block address for inode in imap, adjust for offset - if it’s the current block in question it’s live - otherwise it can be removed</li></ul></li><li>When to clean? - periodically, when you have to, or when idle</li><li>What to clean? What is worth cleaning? - more challenging<ul><li>Originally the split into “cold” and “hot” segments - hot had files that were updated a lot - can wait to clean, cold we’re pretty stable - clean sooner</li></ul></li></ul><p>Crash recovery</p><ul><li>introduce a log</li><li>Checkpoint region points to head and tail segment, each segment points at next segment to be written<ul><li>Crashes during writing to checkpoint region - handled by putting two, one at each end of the disk - start updates with header and timestamp, write body, end with block with timestamp - inconsistency from a crash can be detected and the CR that is latest and consistent can be used</li><li>roll forward on - starts with last checkpoint region, read through log and apply updates that found to get as recovered as possible</li></ul></li></ul><p>Summary
LFS introduces copy-on-write or shadow paging - no in place overwrite. Main advantage is large writes - way more performant. Generates garbage though, old copies of files spread all over - needs cleaning. Cleaning costs the main controversy with LFS, but ideas inspired many modern file systems.</p><p>Flash-based SSDs
No moving parts - but to write a flash page must delete a flash block, and they eventually wear out.</p><p>Crux: how do you use them but deal with those two issues?</p><p>Bits are represented by the charge on a transistor - <strong>single level cells</strong> (SLC) represent one bit (high for 1 low for 0), there are also <strong>multi-level cells</strong> that represent 2 or 3 bits per transistor. SLC are more expensive and higher performance.</p><p>Cells organized into blocks (erase blocks) of 128kb or 256kb (usually), and pages ~4kb - obviously different from blocks and pages in other contexts.</p><p>The interesting thing about flash SSDs is to write to a single page in a block, you must erase the whole block.</p><p>Ops:</p><ul><li>Read (page) - can read anywhere, any page, time doesn’t depend on previous read location - random access device, fast (microseconds )</li><li>Erase (block) - must erase the whole block before programming any page in it, sets everything to 1, kinds of slow operation (milliseconds)</li><li>Program (page) - once a block is erased, program can be used to change some of the 1s to 0s in a page - faster than erase but slower than read, 100s microseconds</li></ul><p>The pages basically have state:</p><ul><li>invalid (initial)</li><li>erased - erased (all ones)</li><li>valid - already programmed</li></ul><p>The only way to write to a valid page, is as above, erase the whole block of pages.</p><p>Raw flash to an actual flash based SSD</p><ul><li>build the SSD out of a bunch of flash chips, behind a controller with its own volatile memory</li><li><strong>Flash translation layer</strong> (FTL) adapter to convert os read / write requests to flash - logic blocks, etc to physical</li></ul><p>Performance</p><ul><li>multiple flash chips used in parallel</li><li>design to avoid <strong>write amplification</strong></li></ul><p>Reliability</p><ul><li>main concern is wear out - so <strong>wear leveling</strong> - try to use all blocks the same so they wear at the same rate</li><li>minimize disturbance- program pages in order to minimize disturbance</li></ul><p>FTL organization</p><ul><li>bad approach - directly map logical to physical - results in wear out depending on workload and really poor write performance (worse than platter)</li><li>use log structured system like with file systems<ul><li>always write to the next free page (spreads over the whole disk)</li><li>needs a mapping table - logical address to physical address</li><li>main issue: garbage collection (with no overwrite there’s a lot of old versions around that can be cleaned up)</li><li>main issue: size of mapping table</li><li>garbage collection: checks for physical pages not pointed to by the map, read live pages in the block, erase block, and write out the live pages from erased block</li><li>mapping table size: for a 1Tb SSD with one entry for 4kb page (4 byte entry), would be 1 Gb of memory<ul><li>could use block based mapping instead - map logical address to a physical block and offset - issue is with small writes, potentially need to read in whole block, it back to a new spot with the new data - and created a garbage block</li></ul></li><li>Solution: hybrid approach to mapping - keep some empty “log blocks” available with full page mapping “log map”, and the rest of blocks in a “data map”. Need to merge and “full merge” to move pages together and keep log blocks so ita a little complex</li><li>Solution: a simpler option - cache recently used translations - can perform poorly though depending on workload</li></ul></li><li>The FTL also has to do <strong>wear leveling</strong> - log system helps but sometimes data is long lived, so even though the log system spreads it out, some blocks can wear at different rates. To compensate it reads data in from those blocks and writes elsewhere so they wear evenly with the rest of the drive</li></ul><p>Data integrity / protection</p><p>Crux: how do you make sure you get the same data out that you put in?</p><p>If the whole disk fails - it’s either working or not and easy to detect, RAID saves you - but other failure modes are possible, where it looks like the disk is working but it has issues with accessing certain sections</p><ul><li>Latent sector errors</li><li>Block corruption</li></ul><p>Latent sector errors - caused by damage to disk in a sector, could be head crash, and cosmic rays can flip bits - error correcting codes can be used to check the data is as expected and recover it if possible, but if it can’t, the disk returns an error.</p><p>Block corruption - more sinister, not detected by the disk, faulty bus or firmware, etc something causes the bits that are written to not be what was expected but the disk can’t tell</p><p>Handling the partial failures:</p><ul><li>LSE easy to detect - when found, try to use whatever redundancy mechanism is in place to restore the data (RAID)</li><li>Corruption - detect using a checksum and restore in the same way as LSE once you find it (the hard part is finding it)</li></ul><p>Other common failure modes:</p><ul><li>Misdirected writes - the controller writes the right data to the wrong block, or even the wrong disk<ul><li>Adding physical id for disk location and block location to the checksum makes this detectable (otherwise the checksum would work)</li></ul></li><li>Lost writes - the write is reported as completed in upper abstraction layers but didn’t actually complete - this isn’t handled by the checksums above. Some systems read back the data they wrote to verify but that doubles io per write. ZFS adds checksums to inodes and indirect blocks so that if the write to block is lost, the checksum with the old data will fail and it can be detected</li></ul><p>Scrubbing - run through all the data, check the checksums and fix errors, usually on a schedule (daily, weekly, etc)</p><p><strong>Distribution</strong></p><p>Distributed systems
Communication - it’s unreliable, how do we deal that? Packet loss is inevitable, etc</p><p>Unreliable communication - sometimes ok, eg UDP - sender has know information about whether the datagram was received, it might not have been, etc</p><p>Reliable communication - send ack, use id that increments to make sure duplicate messages don’t get sent down to receiving program - TCP</p><p>Communication abstractions</p><ul><li>people tried to apply OS abstractions to build shared memory systems, didn’t work though because page faults are costly if you have to go to another machine and dealing with failure is hard (a whole chunk of the address space could disappear if a machine goes down)</li><li>RPC - more usable - send request with the data and function to call on a remote machine, run the function there and return the results to the client</li></ul><p><strong>Sun’s Network File System (NFS)</strong>
