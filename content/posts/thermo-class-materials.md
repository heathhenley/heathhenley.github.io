In the Fall of 2017, while finishing my PhD I taught ChE thermodynamics to a
class of graduate and advanced undergraduate students at the University of Rhode
Island. I recently discovered some of my old course materials and decided to post
them publically. It was a project based class, so after the first few lectures, 
most of the class meetings were spent working on problems and projects.

Either way, I hope they are useful to someone!

You can find the course materials [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ho76h6g2cewqPv4i7lIQsYQqpzfnlkge?usp=sharing)

Of course, if you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me!
