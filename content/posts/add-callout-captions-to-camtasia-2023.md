**TL;DR:** Use the script below to add captions from a .srt file to a Camtasia
2023 project as callouts so they can be edited and styled.

The script is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/heathhenley/captasia). The Camtasia project file is just
a JSON file, so this parses the captions from the .srt file and adds them to
the project file as callouts.

Not intended to produce polished captions, but rather to get the captions into
the project so they can be edited and styled - basically as a time saver for
the initial captioning process. I found I needed to do more than what was
allowed with "captions" so I was making callouts manually, which was tedious.

Here's what the example looks like: https://youtu.be/TprEKrI0jk0
