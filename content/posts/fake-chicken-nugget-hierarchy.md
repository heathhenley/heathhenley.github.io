This is my (the only?) ranking:
1. Spicy dino-nuggets
2. Spicy nuggets
3. Dino nuggets
4. Nuggets

Keep in mind I've been a "most of the time non-meat eater" for a few years now,
so maybe I've got it wrong when talking about the real meat nuggets...For my
other veggie friends out there, I'm a fan of [Nuggs](https://eatnuggs.com/) (if
you're into the substitute thing). They're the closest I've had to real, good
old after school freezer nuggs (I'm an adult, I swear, just ask my hairline).

If you're some form of vegetarian (or maybe an open minded meat eater?), would
be happy to hear your recommendations for other good plant based alternatives!
