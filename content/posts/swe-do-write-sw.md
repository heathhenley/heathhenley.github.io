It's all over the place:

> As a software engineer your job isn't to write code, but to solve problems. 

It's BS. I don't disagree with it, you can't really disagree with something so 
uselessly broad. This quote is basically true of every role in any organization,
especially on the product side. "As a firefighter, your job isn't to put out
fires but to solve problems." Well, true... but specifically, the very 
particular problem of a house being on fire. Likewise, a software engineer's 
job is to solve specific business problems via creating and editing software.

The platitude doesn't tell us anything we didn't already know, but it does sound
nice. 

### Who is this advice actually for?

I think the people sharing this quote usually have one of two goals:

#### Address AI anxiety
With the gist of their post being something like: "Don't worry about being
replaced, you're not just a 'code typer', you're a problem solver!" Or maybe
better: "Make sure you're not behaving like a 'code typer', but as a problem
solver, so that you cannot be easily be replaced."

I just don't see who needs to hear this - especially if you're the type of dev
reading about tech on literally any forum or taking any interest in the craft
outside of work at all.

Of course, I don't disagree that AI can type code pretty well at this point,
especially with careful instruction. We should embrace AI tools. They can make
us way faster and more efficient. But I also think we should turn them off
sometimes...(but I digress, more later).

It's possible that I'm showing my bias from working at a small company where the
same handful of people handle R&D, tech sales / support, dev, and testing, in
that case it's nearly impossible to not build context. Even considering a large
org though, I find it hard to believe that the average developer works with zero
understanding or care about the context and actual business behind their
software and instead just pops tickets off the queue and blindly implements
verbatim.

#### Understanding your customers / business
Yeah of course, but again...who needs to hear it? Is someone who cares enough to
be reading these things, really going to be the type to be just checking the
boxes / typing in code to get a paycheck? 

I'll be the first to admit that my first hand experience is limited here. I've
only spent a short time at a large company as an intern. Even though people were
specialized and siloed there, they still understood what was happening and the
larger picture. They were skilled and focused on problem-solving using their
domain knowledge, not just crossing off TODOs to get to Friday.

I'm not so naive as to imagine that some people don't have this sort of outlook;
but by definition if one had that outlook they wouldn't care about this advice
(or any other non-mandated advice).

I suppose it might take more time to turnover at a big place, maybe some of them
can slip through the cracks. But this type of person would drags down any team;
at a small company, it's painfully and pretty immediately obvious.

#### A People Problem

This motive for the quote is usually something along the lines of: "You're job 
isn't to physically write code - you're going to need soft skill to get things
done and get promoted, etc." I don't disagree with this take at all, you
definitely need to able to understand and communicate the tradeoff of different
approaches, get buy in, etc. I would still argue that this falls under the
umbrella of solving a business problem though software.

### Better Advice (maybe?)

Here's what might actually help:

- Talk to your customers directly when possible. Engineers should do support at
least sometimes. For example, at FarSounder - the engineering team is the
support team, so all have a good understanding of the product and common issues,
etc. I understand that this won't scale or be possible everywhere, but one way 
or another some version of this could be implemented.
- Ship early versions / demos / POCs they can actually use and play with when
it's possible so you can iterate based on their feedback. I use this approach
with client work whenever I can. If it's possible, I aim to deploy something in
the first day or two, even if it's just the bones. For example, I'm working on
an app to allow fisheries scientists to few photos of fish from a sampler and
annotate them (species, etc) so that stats about the region can be calculated.
The first day, I deployed a demo app with a gallery view of images and dummy
data so that the client could start to be involved and give feedback.
  - Caveat: this doesn't work with every type of client, you need to feel it out
    a bit. Less technical clients might need to see something a bit more polished at each iteration.
- Understand their actual problem, not just the solution they think they need 
to solve that problem. IMO this works great with the last point.
- Don't be too principled to use LLMs to make you faster. But also don't let 
them rob you of understanding and learning.
  - Turn off completions sometimes and make sure you can still think. Do some 
  Advent of Code, coding challenges, side projects, etc, w/e floats your boat.

None of this fits in a cute, shareable catchphrase though.

The main thing I realized writing this: my complaining about this useless advice
is probably just as useless as the advice itself. But at least now I got it out
of my system and I can stop turning it over in my head. Congrats, it's your 
problem now!
