Here are some podcasts I've been into lately and why I like them.

> **Note** - I'm not affiliated with any of these podcasts, I'm just a listener.

## Tech
- [Backend Banter](https://www.backendbanter.fm/) - Lane from [boot.dev](https://boot.dev) interviews a variety
of other devs (mostly) and talks about their experiences and projects. I
particularly like that it's not only Golang focused. It's mostly entertainment, but I've
learned a few things from it. I really enjoyed the episodes with [John
Crickett](https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/backend-banter-fm/episodes/050---Python-is-Faster-than-Rust-e2hvpob)
about 'mechanical sympathy' (and also his coding challenges) and the one with
[Thomas
Ballinger](https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/backend-banter-fm/episodes/061---Forget-SQL--use-Typescript-feat--Thomas-Ballinger-e2l3nfj)
about [convex.dev](https://convex.dev) (I've used convex and it's cool). Those two stood out but they're all great listens.
- [Mostly Technical](https://mostlytechnical.com/) - Just started listening to
this one after hearing Aaron Francis' interview on Backend Banter. He also
posted a thread on twitter once that helped me work out a schema / data model
issue I had with optimizing a processing chain for a lot of data. So naturally
been following his updates. This is a lot about Laravel and php, at least
what I've heard so far, and I'm not using those tools - but it's still
entertaining. Kind of makes me want to give Laravel a try...
- [Mapscaping](https://mapscaping.com/) - All the stuff I work on a FarSounder
touches GIS - we're grabbing measurements from sonar and other sensors and
aggregating them into a big map of the ocean floor. I've been listening to this
one to learn more about GPS, LIDAR, and the GIS world in general. There's a
really interesting episode about [high precision GNSS](https://mapscaping.com/podcast/gnss-receivers-why-precise-positioning-will-not-be-coming-to-your-phone-any-time-soon/) and one about
[RTK](https://mapscaping.com/what-is-gnss-rtk/) that were both relevant and
informative for me. I heard about
it after seeing [Brian Timoney's talk at POSTGIS Day
22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Zg8j9X2f-Y). Off topic, but If you haven't
seen this and you're into Postgres / PostGIS stuff you should check it out.  He
walks through live pulling in JSON hockey stats data, analyzing it, and
producing a nice looking hexbin image ENTIRELY using SQL / PostGIS ðŸ¤¯ (just to
show you can). He was a guest on the show at some point afterward talking about
how you should and shouldn't present your GIS skills, and I found out about this
podcast from his promotion of that episode.
- [Darknet Diaries](https://darknetdiaries.com/) - Jack Rhysider tells stories
and interviews cybersecurity experts, pen testers, hackers, etc. I've learned a
lot about security from this one at high level (it's mostly entertainment).
There are a few episodes that are more technical, like one where a pen tester
describes his week of work undercover as a new employee in marketing at a
company, where his task was to figure what he could get access to and how. I
particularly enjoy these types of episodes where pen testers describe a job.
This has made me slightly paranoid, maybe in a good way. For example, a guy came
by our office to 'measure windows' once - claiming to be the buildings owner. I
was so skeptical I followed him around the whole time until I got confirmation
that he was legit ðŸ˜‚. Definitely wouldn't have thought anything of that if I
hadn't heard the episode about a group of physical pen testers getting access to
an office by posing as tech "testing doors"...
- [Pragmatic Engineer](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/podcast) - This is a new one that just launched, the first episode was about all the AI tools that are now available and what that might mean for devs. I'm looking forward to more episodes - I've been following Gergely Orosz's newsletter for a while now and I've enjoyed it (thanks for the recommendation Rich!).

## Product / Business
- [Lenny's Podcast](https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/podcast) - Lenny interviews a variety of high profile people, usually
in product and as a rule, never (almost never) the CEO. Bunch of interesting
stories and insights on product dev, marketing, business in general etc.
- [My First Million](https://www.mfmpod.com/) - Just started this one after hearing it mentioned on Mostly
Technical or Backend Banter. So far very entertaining, and another one where
they are interviewing a variety of successful people and talking about building.
My current favorite episode has been the [one with Anne
Mahlum](https://www.mfmpod.com/from-nonprofit-founder-to-building-a-300m-pilates-business/)
about founding Back on My Feet and then Solidcore.

## Language / Entertainment / Misc.
These are all in Spanish - I learned Spanish a few years ago, and though I don't
speak enough to keep it sharp, listening consistently at least means I can still
understand it.
- [No Hay Tos](https://www.nohaytospodcast.com/) (Mexican Spanish) - this one is
deliberately for language learners but it's mostly just two friends talking
about random stuff, with a bit of a lean towards culture and language learning.
- [Entiende tu mente](https://entiendetumente.info/) (Spain Spanish) - this one
is about psychology and mental health - they start each podcast with a question
from a listener and then discuss the suggested topic or help with them with
their issue.
- [Caso 63](https://open.spotify.com/show/20ch3IIqtWSSM4nfy11ZzP) (Chilean Spanish) - this one is a very sci-fi podcast show series, I don't want to give
anything away but it's really good and I wasn't able to put it down. I listened
to it while I was running and I remember a couple times I ran longer or kept
walking afterward just because I had to hear the next episode.


## Any recommendations?
Those are the podcasts that have been filling my queue lately. I'm always
looking for new ones to add to the list - so if you have any recommendations
send them my way!
