By Ted Chiang

## Summary
This is a collection of short stories by Ted Chiang - they're all sci-fi /
fantasy themed and varied in theme and style. All of them are pretty short reads.

## Notes
This is one of my favorite books / collections and got me interested in short
stories. I read this book a while back, idk like a decade now, and some of the
stories stuck with me even after all that time. Given that, I decided it was
time to re-read it. I've changed enough since then, that some of the stories
have also changed for me, which is a cool experience. I'm going to start the
year with an almost back-to-back - (books becoming available off my waitlist at
the library is pre-empting this idea) read of this and Exhalation, which is his
second and most recent collection of short stories). Ted Chiang somehow got me
into Ken Liu's books, which I also love, especially his short stories.
