By Ted Chiang

## Summary
This is a collection of short stories by Ted Chiang - they're all sci-fi /
fantasy themed and varied in theme and style. All of them are pretty short reads.

## Notes
This is one of my favorite books / collection and got me interested in short
stories. I read this book a while back (idk like a decade now?) and some of the
stories stuck with me even after all that time. Given that, I decided it was time to
re-read it. I've changed enough since then, that some of the stories have also
changed for me, which is a cool experience. I'm going to start the year with an
(almost - book becoming available off my waitlist at the library is pre-empting
this) back-to-back read of this and Exhalation (second collection of his short
stories). Ted Chiang somehow (I don't remember the connection) got me into Ken
Liu's books, which I also love, especially his short stories.
