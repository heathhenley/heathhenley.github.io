## Summary
I like this idea a lot in this one - there are some 'unknowns' that are capable
of erasing themselves from memory, etc. The story is about a
researcher running the division set up to contain and control them. It's
pretty out there at the end especially but it's an interesting story. Not
told in a linear way - jumps around and can be hard to follow. I listened to this one but I definitely would recommend reading it instead.
