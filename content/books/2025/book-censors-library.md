Finished 9/1/25

This was entertaining, I read it in a couple days but mostly one sitting on a plane.

Inspired by Brave New World / 1984 / Fahrenheit 451. Shout outs and references to a lot of classic literature books. It's about an authoritarian future where books are banned. The main character gets a job as a book censor where he must read with and evaluate books to ban without being affected by their meaning.

Great ending that I sort of wish wrapped up a bit more but I get it, definitely well done and got me thinking a bit - and I appreciate that it's such a short read. For the most part I read the whole book on a single flight.
