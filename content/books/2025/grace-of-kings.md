I really enjoyed this first book in the fantasy series by Ken Liu. All of the
other book of his that I have read have been short stories, so it was nice to
see what he could do with a longer book - and the saga continues so he seems to
be a man of extremes.

It's a bit Game of Thrones-esque... politics, warfare, meddling gods, etc.
