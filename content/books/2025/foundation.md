Foundation, Foundation and Empire, Second Foundation

This is a second read through after last reading them in high school, still really liked them, I know it’s a trope but much better than the show and it’s not even similar to be honest - show is more like it’s “inspired by Foundation”. 

Enjoyed them but got a bit burned out and didn’t feel like reading the last two.
