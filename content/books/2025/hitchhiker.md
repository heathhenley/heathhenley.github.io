Another second read - just nice feel good funny reads for me. I didn’t feel like rereading the whole 5 part trilogy, but the first two were enough. 

Not much to say about these - I find them entertaining and packed with great one
liners...

> They hung in the air in much the same way that bricks don't.

> Now there's a frood who really knows where his towel is.

> The thing that used to worry him most was the fact that people always used to ask him what he was looking so worried about.

> If human beings don’t keep exercising their lips, their brains start working.

etc...
