DNF in February- skimmed the second half 

I picked this up due to the awesome quote shared by the Vanta CEO in a podcast: 

> The function of the overwhelming majority of your artwork is simply to teach you how to make the small fraction of your artwork that soars.

There are some other good ones in there - but it could have ended at the first half or really been an essay. I don't have the patience for fluff these days (unless it's entertaining!)
