Based on the idea / quote by Edmund Wilson: 
> No two persons ever read the same book.

Each chapter follows a different person from very different walks of life as they are affected by a book in their own ways.

I love the idea of this one - I found that it kind of long in framing the lives of each individual person vs how they perceived or were affected by the story. I enjoyed it overall though.
