This book is about the author’s career as a wall street trader. But mostly about the boys club of Wall Street trading, the rise and fall of Solomon Brothers, proudly ripping clients off, and people who strive for the unofficial title of  “big swinging dick” 

Kind for of the wolf of Wall Street of books - except it's not satire - it's an ode to the real finance bros of the day - people who really strive to contribute positively to society /s.

Another I had heard mentioned - I liked **The Big Short** so I thought I would give it a try, not one I would recommend though.

Learned about the actual game "Liar's Poker" and that was probably the high point for me lol 

But seriously I did find it interesting to learn about the history of the creation of mortgage backed securities, and bond trading in that era.
