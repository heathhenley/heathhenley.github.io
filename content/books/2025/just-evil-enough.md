Subversive marketing tactics - with case studies and comparisons to traditional tactics.

Listening to this one on Audible - which is probably a mistake, I think I would
be able to take more from it reading it. A bunch of case studies and comparisons
to traditional marketing tactics - people who've "hacked" the system in a
marketing sense.

His appearance on Lenny's Podcast was what motivated me to get it, honestly could maybe just listen to that and get the idea instead, perhaps there's more actionable stuff to gain from reading the book - [here](https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/just-evil-enough-alistair-croll) is the link.
