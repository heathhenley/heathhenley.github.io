This one was about humans in extreme conditions, and the physiology of what their body is going through in those situations. The stories were all invented except one I believe, but nonetheless I enjoyed the book - a bit morbid I guess… 

Each chapter is a case study or story of a person meeting their demise in extreme conditions, with a lot of focus on the physiology of what’s happening to them. I’ve forgotten a lot of the details, but two stories definitely stuck with me. I think about the climbing one whenever I’m climbing, and hopefully that helps remind me to check things an extra time :) 

I also recently did a relay race with some friends, and one of my legs was along a two lane highway in the sun at 100F (there was an uncharacteristic heat wave). In the book there’s a biker who overheats in a competition - pushing too hard in the sun and humidity- can’t say in wasn’t thinking about that story pretty much the whole time I was doing that leg of the race, reminding myself not to push it too hard in the heat.
