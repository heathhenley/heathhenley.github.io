About observing and not taking for granted our surroundings. I am really interested in this because in traveling, I have noticed that I tend to pay more attention to the areas I’m visiting - and I’ve been making more of an effort to do that at home.

The author walks around the same city block many times, first alone, then with her toddler, and then with other experts in very specific areas - asking them all what they see along the way.

It turns out to not be the same block, which I was surprised by and I think it would have been much better if it were.

I loved the idea of this book and point taken - but the author rambles a lot and pontificates instead of talking about what the “experts” said / did.I don’t know what it is about the tone but it’s got a condescending feel to it sometimes. 

Walks: 
- By herself
- With toddler - asides about how toddlers may experience the world, synesthesia, and  fascination with new things - also noticing a lot of things at toddler height 
- Geologist - even in the city, variety of stones and associated stories 
- Letter expert 
- Illustrator
- Bug expert - learned a lot tracking bugs on leaves, etc that was pretty cool actually
- Animal expert
- City planning / traffic expert
- Doctor / gait expert 
- Blind person - this was my favorite so far, focused on other senses and how the guest “sees” the world - still riddled with filler though that I wish wasn’t there
- Sound engineer
- Her dog - mostly about sense of smell in this case and how dogs might see the world 

I think my favorites were actually the walks with blind person and the dog to be honest. I really expected all the walks to be on the same route, but either way, it’s already had the effect of making me pay more attention when I’m out and about, running or walking around the neighborhood.
