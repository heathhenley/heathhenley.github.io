By Elisabeth Tova Bailey

Listened to this one - the author is bedridden, her friend brings her a flower that happens to have a garden snail on it. She befriends the snail and we readers get to learn more about snails (which Iâ€™ve mostly already forgotten) than I thought there was to know.

This was another book that like [[On Looking]] - encouraged me to make sure I am more present and paying attention to more of the small things around me, for that I appreciate it.

So there's that - and if you're really into snails you'll definitely be into this book.
