I thought the idea of this was really interesting - main character is terminal, the devil appears and makes a deal to exchange a day of life for disappearing something from world each day. The catch is the devil picks each day...

So yeah sounded interesting to me, and definitely did make me take a bit of time to reflect on the simple things in life...

But aside from that, and maybe it's the translation - but this is quite literally some of the worst writing that I've read in a very long time. It's a super short read, thankfully - it reads much longer because of how boring it is. I found the dialog especially cringy... 

Not one I can recommend unfortunately...
