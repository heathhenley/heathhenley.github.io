By Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson

Ezra Klein book about how dems/liberals f'd themselves and how they make things that they want to happen sometimes harder, often via regulation. 

A lot of interesting ideas in there, not super prescriptive.

The idea of cities going from a place of opportunity to a luxury item hit me especially as we look to buy a place in the city. 

NIMBY-ish and "lawn sign liberalism" also rang true as supporting some of my anecdotal experience in my neighborhood at least...
