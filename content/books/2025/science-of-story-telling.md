Just getting started - taking a more psychology focused approach than trying to give rules, like other storytelling approaches do. One quote I liked in there already: 

> Most aesthetic absolutes turn relative under pressure. 

Even though he’s talking about storytelling - relevant for much more.

There were some technical tips mentioned like show not tell, and the “South Park” story advice (no “and then”). 

The most I got from it on the first listen - is that people create a mental model of reality, they are all distinct and sometimes flawed. The story should fall out of the character’s flawed idea of reality being exposed as such, in the setting you want. The character’s flaw should have a well thought out and developed backstory, and be very specific. 

It makes sense, I get all the examples. But honestly really hard for me to put into concrete terms - don’t know that I can use it in any affective way. I might listen again or read the actual book to see if that clears it up.
