Listened to this one with Maddy on a couple short road trips and around town. This was entertaining, a lot of STEM focus as the main character is a scientist - I don't want to give too much about the plot away. He wakes up alone, knowing nothing about what's going or where he is and has to piece it all together..."coincidentally" he's a scientist so that helps a bit.

Similar to The Martian IMO, Maddy and I both enjoyed it!
