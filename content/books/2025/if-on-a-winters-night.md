Finished in January sometime (during vacation)

If on a winterâ€™s night, a traveler - Italian Calvino 

This was a second reading since reading it in college - I really love this book. Super meta about reading itself, confusing but in a good way, and of course great writing.

The reader (you, maybe) gets a book - and just as starts to pick up, notices there has been an error at the publisher and the next page is for for another book entirely...

I'll honestly probably read this book again sometime soon...
