By Robert Pirsig 

Not really my cup of coffee but I get the idea - “could have been an e-mail” kind of thing for me, or at least an essay. Maybe in it's time it was better relative to the other books around. It’s one of those books that I’ve heard mentioned for years, so had to read it to see what was going on.

  Basically
- there’s always a balance between logic and emotion (“classical” and “romantic”)
- care and attention to detail, beauty in small things, quality very much the main thread
- engage deeply with work and life as “the way”
- “quality” is the key to everything
