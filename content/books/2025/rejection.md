Another that with each chapter tells the story of a person's life as they cross paths. I loved this book but it's really clearly not going to be for everyone. A lot of internet culture and millennial themes, pretty dark, satirical and very precise writing. I literally laughed out loud a few times during this one. I think it's intentional, but the only thing that took me a while to get used with the author's writing style in this book is that there's a lot of telling vs showing. After the first chapter though I was hooked and got used to the style.
