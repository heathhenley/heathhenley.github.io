## Hi, I’m Heath. 
I’m a Software Engineer at FarSounder, where I develop software for the
processing and display of 3D Forward Looking sonar data. My path to Software
Engineering has been non-traditional. I received a PhD in Chemical Engineering
from the University of Rhode Island, during which I learned how to program and
developed an interest and software development. I took a bunch of computer
science classes and near the end of my grad career I also taught a few. I even
managed to work some software engineering concepts into the curriculum of the
ChE thermodynamics classes I taught.

During my PhD I worked as an intern at FarSounder, and when I completed my
degree I converted into a full-time SWE. I’ve been happily FarSounder’ing ever
since!

Feel free to reach out if you would like to chat about anything.
