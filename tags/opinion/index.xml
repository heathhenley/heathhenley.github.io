I think too much money is after too few novel ideas. We&amp;rsquo;re fueled by &amp;ldquo;irrational exuberance&amp;rdquo; (thanks Alan Greenspan) again - and normal people will somehow get stuck with the bag. Though if you can get past the hype, maybe there are &amp;ldquo;this tech isn&amp;rsquo;t currently trendy&amp;rdquo; discounts to be had.

A big grain of salt: I&amp;rsquo;m not in sales, I&amp;rsquo;m an engineer, about 80% of my day to day is development and post sales support.
We’ve all heard it before… some form of “when you’ve got the sale, shut up” or, “once they’re sold, stop selling”.</description></item></channel></rss>
