The scale and its attached camera is deployed in remote areas and as the fish are caught they are weighed on the scale and their picture is taken.

One the OG server-returns-html way with FastAPI/HTMX and one with Next.js using the app router / RSC / SSR. These are my quick take aways from the point of view of working on them from the perspective of a &amp;ldquo;non-web-dev dev&amp;rdquo;.
Intro I am currently working on two somewhat similar web apps, one using FastAPI with HTMX and one using Next.</description></item></channel></rss>
