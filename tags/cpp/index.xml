Then any buffer overrun becomes immediately obvious!
What happened We have a relatively simple standalone Windows MFC desktop app (old school) whose sole purpose is to take user inputs and call into a third party library with them.</description></item><item><title>Smart Pointer Pointers</title><link>https://heathhenley.dev/posts/smart-pointer-pointers/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 May 2022 10:05:29 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://heathhenley.dev/posts/smart-pointer-pointers/</guid><description>TL;DR - Switch raw heap pointers to unique_ptrs when possible.

So, here’s a note to myself, and anyone else dying to read about smart pointers in C++.</description></item></channel></rss>
