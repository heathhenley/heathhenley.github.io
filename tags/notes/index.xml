I participated in the NSF I-CORPS program quite a while ago now (LA Node, Fall 2016). The goal of the program is to assist scientists with technology transfer. It&amp;rsquo;s basically a crash course in entrepreneurship for STEM researchers. The program takes place over about 8 weeks and participants interview at least 100 people (customers, competitors, thought leaders, and partners) with the goal of finding product-market fit and determining the feasibility of commercializing the result of their NSF sponsored research project.</description></item></channel></rss>
