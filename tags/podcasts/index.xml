Note - I&amp;rsquo;m not affiliated with any of these podcasts, I&amp;rsquo;m just a listener.
Tech Backend Banter - Lane from boot.dev interviews a variety of other devs (mostly) and talks about their experiences and projects. I particularly like that it&amp;rsquo;s not only Golang focused. It&amp;rsquo;s mostly entertainment, but I&amp;rsquo;ve learned a few things from it. I really enjoyed the episodes with John Crickett about &amp;lsquo;mechanical sympathy&amp;rsquo; (and also his coding challenges) and the one with Thomas Ballinger about convex.</description></item></channel></rss>
