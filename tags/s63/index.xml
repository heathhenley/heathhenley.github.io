These are some notes on how with a simple Python script to show what I mean.
So this is an old standard that will soon be replaced by S100, but it&amp;rsquo;s still in place and used today. The encryption part of the scheme is mostly to allow data suppliers to license their data to users in a standardized way and collected payment for access to that data.</description></item><item><title>How Does S-63 Electronic Navigational Chart (ENC) Format Work?</title><link>https://heathhenley.github.io/posts/how-does-s63-enc-format-work/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jan 2024 19:18:13 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://heathhenley.github.io/posts/how-does-s63-enc-format-work/</guid><description>TL;DR: S-63 is a standard used to encrypt official Electronic Navigational Charts (ENCs). Encryption and signing allow clients to be sure that they have official data and that it has not been tampered with. It also make it possible for data providers to license sections of the charts (cells) and be sure that they are not being shared illegally / pirated. This post gives an overview of the process and shows how to implement the key steps.</description></item></channel></rss>
