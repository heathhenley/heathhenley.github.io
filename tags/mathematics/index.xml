It is a very simple algorithm to implement, and it converges quickly in most cases, of course depending on the function. It is often used to find the roots of polynomials. For instance, in Chemical Engineering properties calculations, often cubic equations of state are used to model the behavior of fluids. These equations of state are cubic polynomials and most solved for their roots in most cases in order to compute fluid properties and phase equilibria.</description></item></channel></rss>
