One the OG server-returns-html way with FastAPI/HTMX and one with Next.js using the app router / RSC / SSR. These are my quick take aways from the point of view of working on them from the perspective of a &amp;ldquo;non-web-dev dev&amp;rdquo;.
Intro I am currently working on two somewhat similar web apps, one using FastAPI with HTMX and one using Next.</description></item><item><title>Notes From Cryptopals Challenges</title><link>https://heathhenley.dev/posts/notes-from-cryptopals-challenges/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Dec 2023 12:58:01 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://heathhenley.dev/posts/notes-from-cryptopals-challenges/</guid><description>TL;DR: I&amp;rsquo;m working through the Cryptopals Crypto Challenges, starting with knowing nothing about cryptography. These are my (not so) random notes and takeaways from them.
Set 1 - Basics This was pretty quick and easy set to go through, but I&amp;rsquo;m glad I didn&amp;rsquo;t skip it. It introduced &amp;lsquo;repeating key XOR&amp;rsquo; and how to break some cyphers &amp;lsquo;statistically&amp;rsquo; using letter frequency. The most interesting part of the set was Breaking repeating key XOR and solution</description></item><item><title>Random Notes About Python's Random Module</title><link>https://heathhenley.dev/posts/python-random-module-random-notes/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Dec 2023 12:10:44 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://heathhenley.dev/posts/python-random-module-random-notes/</guid><description>TL;DR: Use the functions in the random module for modeling, simulations, games, sampling, etc. but use os.urandom, secrets, or random.SystemRandom for cryptographic applications. I know very little about cryptography and security, these are just my notes about stuff I recently learned.
It uses the Mersenne Twister algorithm, which is a pseudorandom number generator with a period of 2^19937-1. It is one of the most widely used PRNGs in the world, and suitable for many applications.</description></item><item><title>Error Checking out Large Repo on GitHub Actions Windows Runner</title><link>https://heathhenley.dev/posts/gh-actions-clone-windows-runner-error/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Dec 2023 18:07:36 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://heathhenley.dev/posts/gh-actions-clone-windows-runner-error/</guid><description>TL;DR: If you&amp;rsquo;re getting a weird looking Error: fatal: fetch-pack: invalid index-pack output error checking out a large repo on a GitHub Actions using a Windows Runner, try switching to use HTTPS instead of SSH for your clones (by providing a personal access token instead of an SSH key).
Summary I was recently working on getting CI setup for a project that has a pretty large repo with a few submodules and uses LFS for some large binaries.</description></item><item><title>Some tips for working at a small company (mostly for devs)</title><link>https://heathhenley.dev/posts/small-company/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Oct 2023 19:01:27 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://heathhenley.dev/posts/small-company/</guid><description>Some tips for Working at a Smaller Company (mostly for devs) TL;DR - A small company can be a great place to learn, and it can be a lot easier to see the effects of the results of your work. At the same time, you likely won’t have access to the same structure, level of mentorship, clarity of career path / progression, or resources. In my experience you need to be the kind of person who (1) is happy with being more of a generalist, and (2) take responsibility for your own learning - eg fill in gaps were necessary, go deeper when needed, and lean on outside resources, friends, etc.</description></item><item><title>Refactoring my Simple Python Chatbot Module</title><link>https://heathhenley.dev/posts/refactoring-chatbot-python-module/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Aug 2023 23:40:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://heathhenley.dev/posts/refactoring-chatbot-python-module/</guid><description>TL;DR: cleaned up a simple chatbot module that I wrote in Python, originally as a way to impersonate a friend in my Slack chat.
How it started I wrote a chatbot in python to impersonate one of my friends on Slack. It was a fun project, but originally I set it up a pretty hacky way. Here&amp;rsquo;s an example of what it looks like integrated into slack:
Ok so that&amp;rsquo;s a pretty goofy impersonation of a friend of mine (littered with inside jokes) - but it can actually be useful.</description></item></channel></rss>
