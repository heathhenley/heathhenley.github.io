They probably will at some point - here&amp;rsquo;s the feature request. In the meantime, here&amp;rsquo;s a quick workaround to get it working / deploying.

However, the submodules are not included, and the build will fail.</description></item><item><title>Update Github Profile Readme Dynamically using a Github Workflow</title><link>https://heathhenley.github.io/posts/update-gh-readme-with-action/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Aug 2023 20:44:26 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://heathhenley.github.io/posts/update-gh-readme-with-action/</guid><description>TL;DR: Update your Github Profile Readme dynamically with recent blog posts.

Github Profile Readme Github introduced the option to a add profile readme, which is a special repository that is used to display a readme on your profile page. I wanted to post links to my recent blog posts there, so I wrote a simple python script to check for the latest X posts, and update the readme with links to them.</description></item></channel></rss>
