Summary I was recently working on getting CI setup for a project that has a pretty large repo with a few submodules and uses LFS for some large binaries.</description></item><item><title>Notes: Workaround to use Railway with Git Submodules</title><link>https://heathhenley.dev/posts/workaround-railway-with-git-submodules/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Aug 2023 20:04:45 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://heathhenley.dev/posts/workaround-railway-with-git-submodules/</guid><description>TL;DR - Railway doesn&amp;rsquo;t support git submodules yet. They probably will at some point - here&amp;rsquo;s the feature request. In the meantime, here&amp;rsquo;s a quick workaround to get it working / deploying.
Use Github Workflow You can deploy projects to railway.app directly from github, but they do not support git submodules yet. So your repo gets cloned as usual and railway attempts to build/deploy. However, the submodules are not included, and the build will fail.</description></item><item><title>Update Github Profile Readme Dynamically using a Github Workflow</title><link>https://heathhenley.dev/posts/update-gh-readme-with-action/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Aug 2023 20:44:26 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://heathhenley.dev/posts/update-gh-readme-with-action/</guid><description>TL;DR: Update your Github Profile Readme dynamically with recent blog posts. There&amp;rsquo;s an example (profile and code).
Github Profile Readme Github introduced the option to a add profile readme, which is a special repository that is used to display a readme on your profile page. I wanted to post links to my recent blog posts there, so I wrote a simple python script to check for the latest X posts, and update the readme with links to them.</description></item></channel></rss>
