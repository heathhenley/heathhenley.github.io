They probably will at some point - here&amp;rsquo;s the feature request. In the meantime, here&amp;rsquo;s a quick workaround to get it working / deploying.
Use Github Workflow You can deploy projects to railway.app directly from github, but they do not support git submodules yet. So your repo gets cloned as usual and railway attempts to build/deploy. However, the submodules are not included, and the build will fail.</description></item></channel></rss>
