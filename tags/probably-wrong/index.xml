I think too much money is after too few novel ideas. We&amp;rsquo;re fueled by &amp;ldquo;irrational exuberance&amp;rdquo; (thanks Alan Greenspan) again - and normal people will somehow get stuck with the bag. Though if you can get past the hype, maybe there are &amp;ldquo;this tech isn&amp;rsquo;t currently trendy&amp;rdquo; discounts to be had.
