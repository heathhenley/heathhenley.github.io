Encryption and signing allow clients to be sure that they have official data and that it has not been tampered with. It also make it possible for data providers to license sections of the charts (cells) and be sure that they are not being shared illegally / pirated. All of the examples are implemented in python and available in a Gist.</description></item><item><title>Notes From Cryptopals Challenges</title><link>https://heathhenley.github.io/posts/notes-from-cryptopals-challenges/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Dec 2023 12:58:01 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://heathhenley.github.io/posts/notes-from-cryptopals-challenges/</guid><description>TL;DR: I&amp;rsquo;m working through the Cryptopals Crypto Challenges, starting with knowing nothing about cryptography. These are my (not so) random notes and takeaways from them.
Set 1 - Basics This was pretty quick and easy set to go through, but I&amp;rsquo;m glad I didn&amp;rsquo;t skip it. It introduced &amp;lsquo;repeating key XOR&amp;rsquo; and how to break some cyphers &amp;lsquo;statistically&amp;rsquo; using letter frequency. The most interesting part of the set was Breaking repeating key XOR and solution</description></item></channel></rss>
