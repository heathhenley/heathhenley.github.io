Spit into a few different areas of life.
Biggest and easily the most exciting update (currently redacted)!
If you&amp;rsquo;re reading this, I guess I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to share it (or you&amp;rsquo;ve done something bad and should be ashamed). Here&amp;rsquo;s to another one!
Some cool &amp;ldquo;wrapped&amp;rdquo; shares / stats:

A simple switch to represent the where filters as a tuple makes a huge difference in performance on the exact same data with the same indices. Eg - change where ( a &amp;gt; c or (a = c and b &amp;gt; d )) to where (a, b) &amp;gt; (c, d). In the &amp;ldquo;tuple&amp;rdquo; case postgres can use the index more efficiently and get more of the needed rows using the index condition, versus walking it, reading rows in and filtering.</description></item><item><title>Working on a Fisheries Data Platform</title><link>https://heathhenley.dev/posts/the-fish-app/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 23:47:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://heathhenley.dev/posts/the-fish-app/</guid><description>TL;DR: A side project I&amp;rsquo;m working on is a web interface for the photos collected by a smart scale. The scale and its attached camera is deployed in remote areas and as the fish are caught they are weighed on the scale and their picture is taken. There is a mobile app that coordinates all of that and when the user is back in an area with service / wifi, the photos are sent up to a bucket.</description></item><item><title>Using Gflags Page Heap to Debug on Windows</title><link>https://heathhenley.dev/posts/using-gflags-page-heap-to-debug-on-windows/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jul 2025 20:05:18 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://heathhenley.dev/posts/using-gflags-page-heap-to-debug-on-windows/</guid><description>TL;DR - It sets a global flag so that when the OS allocates memory in your application, it specifically sticks the allocated chunk at the end of the page, with a special no access page after each used page. Then any buffer overrun becomes immediately obvious!
What happened We have a relatively simple standalone Windows MFC desktop app (old school) whose sole purpose is to take user inputs and call into a third party library with them.</description></item><item><title>It's a bubble folks: 'AI' is overhyped</title><link>https://heathhenley.dev/posts/do-we-need-more-openai-wrappers/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jul 2025 18:34:20 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://heathhenley.dev/posts/do-we-need-more-openai-wrappers/</guid><description>TL;DR - Recent advancements with LLMs are awesome, but also overhyped. I think too much money is after too few novel ideas. We&amp;rsquo;re fueled by &amp;ldquo;irrational exuberance&amp;rdquo; (thanks Alan Greenspan) again - and normal people will somehow get stuck with the bag. Though if you can get past the hype, maybe there are &amp;ldquo;this tech isn&amp;rsquo;t currently trendy&amp;rdquo; discounts to be had.

As a software engineer your job isn&amp;rsquo;t to write code, but to solve problems.
It&amp;rsquo;s BS. I don&amp;rsquo;t disagree with it, you can&amp;rsquo;t really disagree with something so uselessly broad. This quote is basically true of every role in any organization, especially on the product side. &amp;ldquo;As a firefighter, your job isn&amp;rsquo;t to put out fires but to solve problems.&amp;rdquo; Well, true&amp;hellip; but specifically, the very particular problem of a house being on fire.</description></item><item><title>Random dice game - sims and DP solution</title><link>https://heathhenley.dev/posts/dice-game-optimal/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Mar 2025 19:07:23 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://heathhenley.dev/posts/dice-game-optimal/</guid><description>TL;DR: I saw a random dice game on social media with no satisfying solutions in the comments, so I played around with it using simulation to test my intuition and then worked out the optimal strategy using dynamic programming.
The game The game has $n$ rounds. You start with $0$ dollars and a 20 sided die (d20) showing the number $1$. Each round, you can take money equal to the number shown, or reroll.</description></item><item><title>Advent of Code 2024 Notes</title><link>https://heathhenley.dev/posts/aoc-notes-2024/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Dec 2024 10:50:52 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://heathhenley.dev/posts/aoc-notes-2024/</guid><description>TL;DR - Misc notes from the 2024 Advent of Code in Python and Ocaml and a little bit of Golang.
The repo with my solutions to the Advent of Code 2024 problems can be found here. This is a bunch of random notes from this year&amp;rsquo;s event, no full write-ups or anything for now just general notes and take-aways.

Recursive functions continue calling themselves until the base case is hit - and then they return. The continued calls keep pushing frames onto the stack and can lead to a stack overflow for large inputs. Some languages include an optimization that cleans this up, provided that the function is written in a way that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to wait for the results for all the other recursive calls to resolve to return.</description></item><item><title>Adding Basic OAuth Flow to a MPA</title><link>https://heathhenley.dev/posts/google-auth-for-new-depths/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Nov 2024 15:09:10 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://heathhenley.dev/posts/google-auth-for-new-depths/</guid><description>TL;DR - For newdepths.xyz I wanted to add a simpler way for users to log in, in that way they can avoid creating a new password just for this little site. I also wanted to implement all the parts of the flow to get a good feel for them and how they fit together. Of course there are a lot of libraries that handle this well, but I think that doing it manually with low stakes is a great way to learn how everything fits together.</description></item><item><title>Podcast Notes and Key Takeaways</title><link>https://heathhenley.dev/posts/podcast-notes/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Nov 2024 22:11:51 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://heathhenley.dev/posts/podcast-notes/</guid><description>TL;DR- just notes and takeaways from recent podcast episodes. They&amp;rsquo;ll mostly be about product development, software engineering, or other tech stuff (GIS related probably).
Podcasts Takeaways and notes from recent podcasts I&amp;rsquo;ve listened to - I&amp;rsquo;m finding that taking actual notes is helping me retain info and more actively listen lately - and I figured why not share publicly in case it gets someone else interested in listening to (or not) the episode.</description></item><item><title>Drawing Cards without Replacement</title><link>https://heathhenley.dev/posts/drawing-without-replacement/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Oct 2024 08:30:07 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://heathhenley.dev/posts/drawing-without-replacement/</guid><description>TL;DR - working out the number of draws it will take to get an Ace if pulling cards randomly without replacing them. Just doing it as &amp;ldquo;an exercise to the reader&amp;rdquo; - sparked by some questions that came about in an Advent of Code discord server I&amp;rsquo;m in. I work out the expected number of draws to the first &amp;lsquo;success&amp;rsquo; (drawing an Ace from a deck of cards, for example) from first principles, in a not-necessarily-rigorous-but-good-enough way (mathematicians don&amp;rsquo;t @ me.</description></item><item><title>Modeling the Cooling in a Propane Tank</title><link>https://heathhenley.dev/posts/campstove-cheme/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Oct 2024 09:19:59 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://heathhenley.dev/posts/campstove-cheme/</guid><description>TL;DR: In a recent camping trip we noticed just how cold our propane tank was getting after cooking for a while - we started out pretty chilly anyway (about 50 F). The physics of this is cool and I wanted to play with modeling it.
I have one of these little two burner propane stoves that we use when camping, it looks something like this:
While we were cooking breakfast and boiling water for coffee, we noticed that the propane tank was getting super cold - there was not only a thick layer of frost forming on the outside, but a small chunk of solid ice on the bottom of the tank where it met the picnic table&amp;hellip;</description></item><item><title>Podcasts I've been into lately</title><link>https://heathhenley.dev/posts/podcasts/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Oct 2024 08:11:51 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://heathhenley.dev/posts/podcasts/</guid><description>Here are some podcasts I&amp;rsquo;ve been into lately and why I like them.
Note - I&amp;rsquo;m not affiliated with any of these podcasts, I&amp;rsquo;m just a listener.
Tech Backend Banter - Lane from boot.dev interviews a variety of other devs (mostly) and talks about their experiences and projects. I particularly like that it&amp;rsquo;s not only Golang focused. It&amp;rsquo;s mostly entertainment, but I&amp;rsquo;ve learned a few things from it. I really enjoyed the episodes with John Crickett about &amp;lsquo;mechanical sympathy&amp;rsquo; (and also his coding challenges) and the one with Thomas Ballinger about convex.</description></item><item><title>Two similar apps with dissimilar tech stacks</title><link>https://heathhenley.dev/posts/implementing-similar-apps-with-dissimilar-stacks/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Aug 2024 06:12:27 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://heathhenley.dev/posts/implementing-similar-apps-with-dissimilar-stacks/</guid><description>TLDR - My general takeaways from working on two similar apps. One the OG server-returns-html way with FastAPI/HTMX and one with Next.js using the app router / RSC / SSR. These are my quick take aways from the point of view of working on them from the perspective of a &amp;ldquo;non-web-dev dev&amp;rdquo;.

We also look at the Lagrange Multiplier method to solve optimization problems subject to constraints (and what the resulting system of nonlinear equations looks like, eg what we could apply Newton-Raphson to, etc).
Introduction Optimization problems are everywhere in engineering and science. If you can model your problem in a way that can write down some function that should be minimized or maximized (the objective function) to get the solution you want, even in cases where there is no analytical solution (most real cases), you can often obtain a numerical solution.</description></item><item><title>Notes: 'Hacking' on S63</title><link>https://heathhenley.dev/posts/hacking-on-s63/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Apr 2024 17:15:41 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://heathhenley.dev/posts/hacking-on-s63/</guid><description>TL;DR: The S63 encryption scheme is old and can be broken pretty easily depending on the information you have. These are some notes on how with a simple Python script to show what I mean.
So this is an old standard that will soon be replaced by S100, but it&amp;rsquo;s still in place and used today. The encryption part of the scheme is mostly to allow data suppliers to license their data to users in a standardized way and collected payment for access to that data.</description></item><item><title>How Does S-63 Electronic Navigational Chart (ENC) Format Work?</title><link>https://heathhenley.dev/posts/how-does-s63-enc-format-work/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jan 2024 19:18:13 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://heathhenley.dev/posts/how-does-s63-enc-format-work/</guid><description>TL;DR: S-63 is a standard used to encrypt official Electronic Navigational Charts (ENCs). Encryption and signing allow clients to be sure that they have official data and that it has not been tampered with. It also make it possible for data providers to license sections of the charts (cells) and be sure that they are not being shared illegally / pirated. This post gives an overview of the process and shows how to implement the key steps.</description></item><item><title>Newton Fractals Are Cool! And a Quick Intro to Newton's Method</title><link>https://heathhenley.dev/posts/newton-fractals-are-cool/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jan 2024 12:46:44 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://heathhenley.dev/posts/newton-fractals-are-cool/</guid><description>Newton&amp;rsquo;s method is a root-finding algorithm that can be used to find the roots of differentiable functions. It is a very simple algorithm to implement, and it converges quickly in most cases, of course depending on the function. It is often used to find the roots of polynomials. For instance, in Chemical Engineering properties calculations, often cubic equations of state are used to model the behavior of fluids. These equations of state are cubic polynomials and most solved for their roots in most cases in order to compute fluid properties and phase equilibria.</description></item><item><title>Add Callout Captions to Camtasia 2023</title><link>https://heathhenley.dev/posts/add-callout-captions-to-camtasia-2023/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Jan 2024 19:14:18 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://heathhenley.dev/posts/add-callout-captions-to-camtasia-2023/</guid><description>TL;DR: Use the script below to add captions from a .srt file to a Camtasia 2023 project as callouts so they can be edited and styled.
The script is available on GitHub. The Camtasia project file is just a JSON file, so this parses the captions from the .srt file and adds them to the project file as callouts.
Not intended to produce polished captions, but rather to get the captions into the project so they can be edited and styled - basically as a time saver for the initial captioning process.</description></item><item><title>The Cryptopals Challenges</title><link>https://heathhenley.dev/posts/notes-from-cryptopals-challenges/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Dec 2023 12:58:01 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://heathhenley.dev/posts/notes-from-cryptopals-challenges/</guid><description>TL;DR: I&amp;rsquo;m working through the Cryptopals Cryptography Challenges, starting with knowing nothing about cryptography. These are my (not so) random notes and takeaways from them. They generally seem to follow a pattern of introducing a concept in cryptography (repeating key XOR, ECB mode, CBC mode, stream ciphers, etc) and then having you break it in some way(s). I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to turn my notes on some of these in to more detailed posts at some point, but for now, this mostly &amp;lsquo;stream of thought&amp;rsquo; that I&amp;rsquo;m updating as I work through them.</description></item><item><title>Random Notes About Python's Random Module</title><link>https://heathhenley.dev/posts/python-random-module-random-notes/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Dec 2023 12:10:44 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://heathhenley.dev/posts/python-random-module-random-notes/</guid><description>TL;DR: Use the functions in the random module for modeling, simulations, games, sampling, etc. but use os.urandom, secrets, or random.SystemRandom for cryptographic applications. I know very little about cryptography and security, these are just my notes about stuff I recently learned.
It uses the Mersenne Twister algorithm, which is a pseudorandom number generator with a period of 2^19937-1. It is one of the most widely used PRNGs in the world, and suitable for many applications.</description></item><item><title>Error Checking out Large Repo on GitHub Actions Windows Runner</title><link>https://heathhenley.dev/posts/gh-actions-clone-windows-runner-error/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Dec 2023 18:07:36 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://heathhenley.dev/posts/gh-actions-clone-windows-runner-error/</guid><description>TL;DR: If you&amp;rsquo;re getting a weird looking Error: fatal: fetch-pack: invalid index-pack output error checking out a large repo on a GitHub Actions using a Windows Runner, try switching to use HTTPS instead of SSH for your clones (by providing a personal access token instead of an SSH key).

At the same time, you likely won’t have access to the same structure, level of mentorship, clarity of career path / progression, or resources. In my experience you need to be the kind of person who (1) is happy with being more of a generalist, and (2) take responsibility for your own learning - eg fill in gaps were necessary, go deeper when needed, and lean on outside resources, friends, etc.</description></item><item><title>Highlight Text From Multiple User Selections in React</title><link>https://heathhenley.dev/posts/highlight-text-from-selection-react/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Oct 2023 18:06:57 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://heathhenley.dev/posts/highlight-text-from-selection-react/</guid><description>TL;DR - This is a simple React component that allows you to make multiple highlights in a text from user selections.
Why? Working on a side project I wanted a way for users (and me as the current only user) to save words that they don&amp;rsquo;t know from a text. I found this great example blog that demonstrated one way to do this in React, but it didn&amp;rsquo;t allow for multiple highlights.</description></item><item><title>Writing in Target Language Everyday and Writescribir</title><link>https://heathhenley.dev/posts/writing-in-target-language-everyday/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Oct 2023 08:00:26 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://heathhenley.dev/posts/writing-in-target-language-everyday/</guid><description>TL;DR: I think that writing in your target language everyday is a great way to improve your writing skills!

A big grain of salt: I&amp;rsquo;m not in sales, I&amp;rsquo;m an engineer, about 80% of my day to day is development and post sales support.
We’ve all heard it before… some form of “when you’ve got the sale, shut up” or, “once they’re sold, stop selling”.</description></item><item><title>Modeling Sales Pipeline using Monte Carlo Simulation</title><link>https://heathhenley.dev/posts/modeling-sales-pipeline-with-monte-carlo/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Sep 2023 12:44:58 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://heathhenley.dev/posts/modeling-sales-pipeline-with-monte-carlo/</guid><description>TL;DR - Monte Carlo Simulation can be used to model your historical sales pipeline data to account for some of the randomness and uncertainty in the sales process. In this post, Monte Carlo Simulation is introduced and then applied to the same case introduced in a previous post.
What is Monte Carlo Simulation? Monte Carlo Simulation is used to simulate a process using random sampling. It is a very general technique that can be used to model all kinds of processes in fields ranging from physics and chemistry, to economics and finance.</description></item><item><title>Notes: Workaround to use Railway with Git Submodules</title><link>https://heathhenley.dev/posts/workaround-railway-with-git-submodules/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Aug 2023 20:04:45 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://heathhenley.dev/posts/workaround-railway-with-git-submodules/</guid><description>TL;DR - Railway doesn&amp;rsquo;t support git submodules yet. They probably will at some point - here&amp;rsquo;s the feature request. In the meantime, here&amp;rsquo;s a quick workaround to get it working / deploying.
Use Github Workflow You can deploy projects to railway.app directly from github, but they do not support git submodules yet. So your repo gets cloned as usual and railway attempts to build/deploy. However, the submodules are not included, and the build will fail.</description></item><item><title>Update Github Profile Readme Dynamically using a Github Workflow</title><link>https://heathhenley.dev/posts/update-gh-readme-with-action/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Aug 2023 20:44:26 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://heathhenley.dev/posts/update-gh-readme-with-action/</guid><description>TL;DR: Update your Github Profile Readme dynamically with recent blog posts. There&amp;rsquo;s an example (profile and code).
Github Profile Readme Github introduced the option to a add profile readme, which is a special repository that is used to display a readme on your profile page. I wanted to post links to my recent blog posts there, so I wrote a simple python script to check for the latest X posts, and update the readme with links to them.</description></item><item><title>Refactoring my Simple Python Chatbot Module</title><link>https://heathhenley.dev/posts/refactoring-chatbot-python-module/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Aug 2023 23:40:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://heathhenley.dev/posts/refactoring-chatbot-python-module/</guid><description>TL;DR: cleaned up a simple chatbot module that I wrote in Python, originally as a way to impersonate a friend in my Slack chat.
How it started I wrote a chatbot in python to impersonate one of my friends on Slack. It was a fun project, but originally I set it up a pretty hacky way. Here&amp;rsquo;s an example of what it looks like integrated into slack:
Ok so that&amp;rsquo;s a pretty goofy impersonation of a friend of mine (littered with inside jokes) - but it can actually be useful.</description></item><item><title>Notes: Django w/ PostGIS on GCP Cloud Run and Github Actions</title><link>https://heathhenley.dev/posts/django-postgis-cloud-run-gh-actions/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Aug 2023 17:58:22 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://heathhenley.dev/posts/django-postgis-cloud-run-gh-actions/</guid><description>TL;DR: this a short post about the configuration steps I took to get django running with the GDAL extension and postgreSQL/postGIS backend.

This lets you estimate the future value of your current pipeline based on your own past data.
What is a Markov Chain? It is a mathematical model used to describe how probabilistic systems or processes evolve over time.</description></item><item><title>ChE 513 Course Materials - ChE Thermodynamics (Graduate Level)</title><link>https://heathhenley.dev/posts/thermo-class-materials/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 May 2023 13:08:44 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://heathhenley.dev/posts/thermo-class-materials/</guid><description>In the Fall of 2017, while finishing my PhD I taught ChE thermodynamics to a class of graduate and advanced undergraduate students at the University of Rhode Island.

Motivation At FarSounder I work on the development software of 3D Forward Looking Sonar products.

To that end, we&amp;rsquo;re often out on the Narragansett Bay collecting data with the system, and always looking for areas in the bay with interesting features that we can use to test and benchmark our algorithms (pilings, super steep shoals, rock piles, piers, etc).</description></item><item><title>About me</title><link>https://heathhenley.dev/about/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Oct 2022 19:01:27 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://heathhenley.dev/about/</guid><description>Hi, I’m Heath.

I participated in the NSF I-CORPS program quite a while ago now (LA Node, Fall 2016). The goal of the program is to assist scientists with technology transfer. It&amp;rsquo;s basically a crash course in entrepreneurship for STEM researchers. The program takes place over about 8 weeks and participants interview at least 100 people (customers, competitors, thought leaders, and partners) with the goal of finding product-market fit and determining the feasibility of commercializing the result of their NSF sponsored research project.</description></item><item><title>Smart Pointer Pointers</title><link>https://heathhenley.dev/posts/smart-pointer-pointers/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 May 2022 10:05:29 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://heathhenley.dev/posts/smart-pointer-pointers/</guid><description>TL;DR - Switch raw heap pointers to unique_ptrs when possible. If your heap allocated resource needs multiple owners, use a shared_ptr instead.
I find myself reviewing C++ smart pointer types over and over again. I guess for me, it’s just been one of those things that doesn’t stick, or perhaps I’ve only needed to use them infrequently enough to forget about them.

With a quick google search you can find the Wiki or a trillion other blogs about it - most will show the canonical example - the “hello world” of the topic - that is, using memoization to optimize a recursive implementation of a function that generates the n-th Fibonacci number (or sometimes a function computing factorials).</description></item><item><title>'Chicken' Nugget Hierarchy</title><link>https://heathhenley.dev/posts/fake-chicken-nugget-hierarchy/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Apr 2021 20:54:43 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://heathhenley.dev/posts/fake-chicken-nugget-hierarchy/</guid><description>This is my (the only?) ranking:

Overall I enjoyed it.</description></item><item><title>The Grace of Kings</title><link>https://heathhenley.dev/books/2025/grace-of-kings/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://heathhenley.dev/books/2025/grace-of-kings/</guid><description>By Ken Liu

I really enjoyed this first book in the fantasy series by Ken Liu. All of the other book of his that I have read have been short stories, so it was nice to see what he could do with a longer book - and the saga continues so he seems to be a man of extremes.
It&amp;rsquo;s a bit Game of Thrones-esque&amp;hellip; politics, warfare, meddling gods, etc.</description></item><item><title>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</title><link>https://heathhenley.dev/books/2025/hitchhiker/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://heathhenley.dev/books/2025/hitchhiker/</guid><description>By Douglas Adams
Another second read - just nice feel good funny reads for me. I didn’t feel like rereading the whole 5 part trilogy, but the first two were enough.
Not much to say about these - I find them entertaining and packed with great one liners&amp;hellip;
They hung in the air in much the same way that bricks don&amp;rsquo;t.
Now there&amp;rsquo;s a frood who really knows where his towel is.</description></item><item><title>The Science of Storytelling</title><link>https://heathhenley.dev/books/2025/science-of-story-telling/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://heathhenley.dev/books/2025/science-of-story-telling/</guid><description>By Will Storr
Just getting started - taking a more psychology focused approach than trying to give rules, like other storytelling approaches do. One quote I liked in there already:
Most aesthetic absolutes turn relative under pressure.
Even though he’s talking about storytelling - relevant for much more.
There were some technical tips mentioned like show not tell, and the “South Park” story advice (no “and then”).
The most I got from it on the first listen - is that people create a mental model of reality, they are all distinct and sometimes flawed.</description></item><item><title>There Is No Antimemetics Division</title><link>https://heathhenley.dev/books/2026/there-is-no/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://heathhenley.dev/books/2026/there-is-no/</guid><description>By qntm

Summary I like this idea a lot in this one - there are some &amp;lsquo;unknowns&amp;rsquo; that are capable of erasing themselves from memory, etc. The story is about a researcher running the division set up to contain and control them. It&amp;rsquo;s pretty out there at the end especially but it&amp;rsquo;s an interesting story. Not told in a linear way - jumps around and can be hard to follow.</description></item><item><title>Tiny Experiments</title><link>https://heathhenley.dev/books/2026/tiny-experiments/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://heathhenley.dev/books/2026/tiny-experiments/</guid><description>By Anne-Laure Le Cunff

Summary More overall - don&amp;rsquo;t set linear goals, focus on exploring and letting curiosity thrive and guide you, make &amp;ldquo;tiny experiments&amp;rdquo; from:
observations about your own life, feelings, thoughts, etc hypotheses about what might help you pact to try something that will test the hypothesis review / iterate / reflect on the results I inevitably find these types of books long winded but I appreciate this one.</description></item><item><title>Wild Snail Eating</title><link>https://heathhenley.dev/books/2025/wild-snail-eating/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://heathhenley.dev/books/2025/wild-snail-eating/</guid><description>By Elisabeth Tova Bailey
Listened to this one - the author is bedridden, her friend brings her a flower that happens to have a garden snail on it. She befriends the snail and we readers get to learn more about snails (which I’ve mostly already forgotten) than I thought there was to know.
This was another book that like [[On Looking]] - encouraged me to make sure I am more present and paying attention to more of the small things around me, for that I appreciate it.</description></item><item><title>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</title><link>https://heathhenley.dev/books/2025/motorcyle-maint/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://heathhenley.dev/books/2025/motorcyle-maint/</guid><description>By Robert Pirsig
Not really my cup of coffee but I get the idea - “could have been an e-mail” kind of thing for me, or at least an essay. Maybe in it&amp;rsquo;s time it was better relative to the other books around. It’s one of those books that I’ve heard mentioned for years, so had to read it to see what was going on.
Basically
there’s always a balance between logic and emotion (“classical” and “romantic”) care and attention to detail, beauty in small things, quality very much the main thread engage deeply with work and life as “the way” “quality” is the key to everything</description></item></channel></rss>
