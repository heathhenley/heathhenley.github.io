These are some notes on how with a simple Python script to show what I mean.
So this is an old standard that will soon be replaced by S100, but it&amp;rsquo;s still in place and used today. The encryption part of the scheme is mostly to allow data suppliers to license their data to users in a standardized way and collected payment for access to that data.</description></item><item><title>How Does S-63 Electronic Navigational Chart (ENC) Format Work?</title><link>https://heathhenley.github.io/posts/how-does-s63-enc-format-work/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jan 2024 19:18:13 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://heathhenley.github.io/posts/how-does-s63-enc-format-work/</guid><description>TL;DR: S-63 is a standard used to encrypt official Electronic Navigational Charts (ENCs). Encryption and signing allow clients to be sure that they have official data and that it has not been tampered with. It also make it possible for data providers to license sections of the charts (cells) and be sure that they are not being shared illegally / pirated. This post gives an overview of the process and shows how to implement the key steps.</description></item><item><title>Newton Fractals Are Cool! And a Quick Intro to Newton's Method</title><link>https://heathhenley.github.io/posts/newton-fractals-are-cool/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jan 2024 12:46:44 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://heathhenley.github.io/posts/newton-fractals-are-cool/</guid><description>Newton&amp;rsquo;s method is a root-finding algorithm that can be used to find the roots of differentiable functions. It is a very simple algorithm to implement, and it converges quickly in most cases, of course depending on the function. It is often used to find the roots of polynomials. For instance, in Chemical Engineering properties calculations, often cubic equations of state are used to model the behavior of fluids. These equations of state are cubic polynomials and most solved for their roots in most cases in order to compute fluid properties and phase equilibria.</description></item><item><title>Add Callout Captions to Camtasia 2023</title><link>https://heathhenley.github.io/posts/add-callout-captions-to-camtasia-2023/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Jan 2024 19:14:18 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://heathhenley.github.io/posts/add-callout-captions-to-camtasia-2023/</guid><description>TL;DR: Use the script below to add captions from a .srt file to a Camtasia 2023 project as callouts so they can be edited and styled.
The script is available on GitHub. The Camtasia project file is just a JSON file, so this parses the captions from the .srt file and adds them to the project file as callouts.
Not intended to produce polished captions, but rather to get the captions into the project so they can be edited and styled - basically as a time saver for the initial captioning process.</description></item><item><title>Notes From Cryptopals Challenges</title><link>https://heathhenley.github.io/posts/notes-from-cryptopals-challenges/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Dec 2023 12:58:01 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://heathhenley.github.io/posts/notes-from-cryptopals-challenges/</guid><description>TL;DR: I&amp;rsquo;m working through the Cryptopals Crypto Challenges, starting with knowing nothing about cryptography.

I know very little about cryptography and security, these are just my notes about stuff I recently learned.
It uses the Mersenne Twister algorithm, which is a pseudorandom number generator with a period of 2^19937-1. It is one of the most widely used PRNGs in the world, and suitable for many applications.</description></item><item><title>Error Checking out Large Repo on GitHub Actions Windows Runner</title><link>https://heathhenley.github.io/posts/gh-actions-clone-windows-runner-error/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Dec 2023 18:07:36 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://heathhenley.github.io/posts/gh-actions-clone-windows-runner-error/</guid><description>TL;DR: If you&amp;rsquo;re getting a weird looking Error: fatal: fetch-pack: invalid index-pack output error checking out a large repo on a GitHub Actions using a Windows Runner, try switching to use HTTPS instead of SSH for your clones (by providing a personal access token instead of an SSH key).

At the same time, you likely won’t have access to the same structure, level of mentorship, clarity of career path / progression, or resources. In my experience you need to be the kind of person who (1) is happy with being more of a generalist, and (2) take responsibility for your own learning - eg fill in gaps were necessary, go deeper when needed, and lean on outside resources, friends, etc.</description></item><item><title>Highlight Text From Multiple User Selections in React</title><link>https://heathhenley.github.io/posts/highlight-text-from-selection-react/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Oct 2023 18:06:57 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://heathhenley.github.io/posts/highlight-text-from-selection-react/</guid><description>TL;DR - This is a simple React component that allows you to make multiple highlights in a text from user selections.
Why? Working on a side project I wanted a way for users (and me as the current only user) to save words that they don&amp;rsquo;t know from a text. I found this great example blog that demonstrated one way to do this in React, but it didn&amp;rsquo;t allow for multiple highlights.</description></item><item><title>Writing in Target Language Everyday and Writescribir</title><link>https://heathhenley.github.io/posts/writing-in-target-language-everyday/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Oct 2023 08:00:26 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://heathhenley.github.io/posts/writing-in-target-language-everyday/</guid><description>TL;DR: I think that writing in your target language everyday is a great way to improve your writing skills!

In this post, Monte Carlo Simulation is introduced and then applied to the same case introduced in a previous post.
What is Monte Carlo Simulation? Monte Carlo Simulation is used to simulate a process using random sampling. It is a very general technique that can be used to model all kinds of processes in fields ranging from physics and chemistry, to economics and finance.</description></item><item><title>Notes: Workaround to use Railway with Git Submodules</title><link>https://heathhenley.github.io/posts/workaround-railway-with-git-submodules/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Aug 2023 20:04:45 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://heathhenley.github.io/posts/workaround-railway-with-git-submodules/</guid><description>TL;DR - Railway doesn&amp;rsquo;t support git submodules yet. They probably will at some point - here&amp;rsquo;s the feature request. In the meantime, here&amp;rsquo;s a quick workaround to get it working / deploying.
Use Github Workflow You can deploy projects to railway.app directly from github, but they do not support git submodules yet. So your repo gets cloned as usual and railway attempts to build/deploy. However, the submodules are not included, and the build will fail.</description></item><item><title>Update Github Profile Readme Dynamically using a Github Workflow</title><link>https://heathhenley.github.io/posts/update-gh-readme-with-action/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Aug 2023 20:44:26 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://heathhenley.github.io/posts/update-gh-readme-with-action/</guid><description>TL;DR: Update your Github Profile Readme dynamically with recent blog posts.

Motivation At FarSounder I work on the development software of 3D Forward Looking Sonar products. Part of that development process of course includes collecting data from a lot of different situations and running it through some processing algorithms to evaluate performance and make improvements. To that end, we&amp;rsquo;re often out on the Narragansett Bay collecting data with the system, and always looking for areas in the bay with interesting features that we can use to test and benchmark our algorithms (pilings, super steep shoals, rock piles, piers, etc).</description></item><item><title>About me</title><link>https://heathhenley.github.io/about/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Oct 2022 19:01:27 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://heathhenley.github.io/about/</guid><description>Hi, I’m Heath.

I participated in the NSF I-CORPS program quite a while ago now (LA Node, Fall 2016). The goal of the program is to assist scientists with technology transfer. It&amp;rsquo;s basically a crash course in entrepreneurship for STEM researchers. The program takes place over about 8 weeks and participants interview at least 100 people (customers, competitors, thought leaders, and partners) with the goal of finding product-market fit and determining the feasibility of commercializing the result of their NSF sponsored research project.</description></item><item><title>Smart Pointer Pointers</title><link>https://heathhenley.github.io/posts/smart-pointer-pointers/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 May 2022 10:05:29 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://heathhenley.github.io/posts/smart-pointer-pointers/</guid><description>TL;DR - Switch raw heap pointers to unique_ptrs when possible. If your heap allocated resource needs multiple owners, use a shared_ptr instead.
I find myself reviewing C++ smart pointer types over and over again. I guess for me, it’s just been one of those things that doesn’t stick, or perhaps I’ve only needed to use them infrequently enough to forget about them. So, here’s a note to myself, and anyone else dying to read about smart pointers in C++.</description></item><item><title>Resumen: El Valle De Los Lobos</title><link>https://heathhenley.github.io/posts/resumen-el-valle-de-los-lobos/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Feb 2022 13:47:41 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://heathhenley.github.io/posts/resumen-el-valle-de-los-lobos/</guid><description>Introducción El valle de los lobos es un libro para adolescentes que narra las aventuras inesperadas de una niña que se llama Dana.

Usually, at least in my experience, it’s one of the first topics introduced when dynamic programming algorithms are being discussed. With a quick google search you can find the Wiki or a trillion other blogs about it - most will show the canonical example - the “hello world” of the topic - that is, using memoization to optimize a recursive implementation of a function that generates the n-th Fibonacci number (or sometimes a function computing factorials).</description></item><item><title>'Chicken' Nugget Hierarchy</title><link>https://heathhenley.github.io/posts/fake-chicken-nugget-hierarchy/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Apr 2021 20:54:43 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://heathhenley.github.io/posts/fake-chicken-nugget-hierarchy/</guid><description>This is my (the only?) ranking:
