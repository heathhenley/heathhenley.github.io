I’m a Software Engineer at FarSounder, where I develop software for the processing and display of 3D Forward Looking sonar data. My path to Software Engineering has been non-traditional. I received a PhD in Chemical Engineering from the University of Rhode Island, during which I learned how to program and developed an interest and software development. I took a bunch of programming and software engineering classes. Near the end of my grad career I also taught a few software classes, and managed to work some software engineering concepts like version control in the curriculum of the ChE thermodynamics classes I taught.</description></item></channel></rss>
