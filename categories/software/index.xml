One the OG server-returns-html way with FastAPI/HTMX and one with Next.js using the app router / RSC / SSR. These are my quick take aways from the point of view of working on them from the perspective of a non-web dev.
Intro I am currently working on two somewhat similar web apps, one using FastAPI with HTMX and one using Next.js.

These are my (not so) random notes and takeaways from them.
Set 1 - Basics This was pretty quick and easy set to go through, but I&amp;rsquo;m glad I didn&amp;rsquo;t skip it. It introduced &amp;lsquo;repeating key XOR&amp;rsquo; and how to break some cyphers &amp;lsquo;statistically&amp;rsquo; using letter frequency. The most interesting part of the set was Breaking repeating key XOR and solution</description></item><item><title>Random Notes About Python's Random Module</title><link>https://heathhenley.dev/posts/python-random-module-random-notes/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Dec 2023 12:10:44 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://heathhenley.dev/posts/python-random-module-random-notes/</guid><description>TL;DR: Use the functions in the random module for modeling, simulations, games, sampling, etc. but use os.urandom, secrets, or random.SystemRandom for cryptographic applications. I know very little about cryptography and security, these are just my notes about stuff I recently learned.
It uses the Mersenne Twister algorithm, which is a pseudorandom number generator with a period of 2^19937-1. It is one of the most widely used PRNGs in the world, and suitable for many applications.</description></item><item><title>Error Checking out Large Repo on GitHub Actions Windows Runner</title><link>https://heathhenley.dev/posts/gh-actions-clone-windows-runner-error/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Dec 2023 18:07:36 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://heathhenley.dev/posts/gh-actions-clone-windows-runner-error/</guid><description>TL;DR: If you&amp;rsquo;re getting a weird looking Error: fatal: fetch-pack: invalid index-pack output error checking out a large repo on a GitHub Actions using a Windows Runner, try switching to use HTTPS instead of SSH for your clones (by providing a personal access token instead of an SSH key).
Summary I was recently working on getting CI setup for a project that has a pretty large repo with a few submodules and uses LFS for some large binaries.</description></item><item><title>Some tips for working at a small company (mostly for devs)</title><link>https://heathhenley.dev/posts/small-company/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Oct 2023 19:01:27 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://heathhenley.dev/posts/small-company/</guid><description>Some tips for Working at a Smaller Company (mostly for devs) TL;DR - A small company can be a great place to learn, and it can be a lot easier to see the effects of the results of your work. At the same time, you likely won’t have access to the same structure, level of mentorship, clarity of career path / progression, or resources. In my experience you need to be the kind of person who (1) is happy with being more of a generalist, and (2) take responsibility for your own learning - eg fill in gaps were necessary, go deeper when needed, and lean on outside resources, friends, etc.</description></item><item><title>Notes: Workaround to use Railway with Git Submodules</title><link>https://heathhenley.dev/posts/workaround-railway-with-git-submodules/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Aug 2023 20:04:45 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://heathhenley.dev/posts/workaround-railway-with-git-submodules/</guid><description>TL;DR - Railway doesn&amp;rsquo;t support git submodules yet. They probably will at some point - here&amp;rsquo;s the feature request. In the meantime, here&amp;rsquo;s a quick workaround to get it working / deploying.
Use Github Workflow You can deploy projects to railway.app directly from github, but they do not support git submodules yet. So your repo gets cloned as usual and railway attempts to build/deploy. However, the submodules are not included, and the build will fail.</description></item><item><title>Update Github Profile Readme Dynamically using a Github Workflow</title><link>https://heathhenley.dev/posts/update-gh-readme-with-action/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Aug 2023 20:44:26 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://heathhenley.dev/posts/update-gh-readme-with-action/</guid><description>TL;DR: Update your Github Profile Readme dynamically with recent blog posts. There&amp;rsquo;s an example (profile and code).
Github Profile Readme Github introduced the option to a add profile readme, which is a special repository that is used to display a readme on your profile page. I wanted to post links to my recent blog posts there, so I wrote a simple python script to check for the latest X posts, and update the readme with links to them.</description></item><item><title>Refactoring my Simple Python Chatbot Module</title><link>https://heathhenley.dev/posts/refactoring-chatbot-python-module/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Aug 2023 23:40:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://heathhenley.dev/posts/refactoring-chatbot-python-module/</guid><description>TL;DR: cleaned up a simple chatbot module that I wrote in Python, originally as a way to impersonate a friend in my Slack chat.
How it started I wrote a chatbot in python to impersonate one of my friends on Slack. It was a fun project, but originally I set it up a pretty hacky way. Here&amp;rsquo;s an example of what it looks like integrated into slack:
Ok so that&amp;rsquo;s a pretty goofy impersonation of a friend of mine (littered with inside jokes) - but it can actually be useful.</description></item><item><title>Notes: Django w/ PostGIS on GCP Cloud Run and Github Actions</title><link>https://heathhenley.dev/posts/django-postgis-cloud-run-gh-actions/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Aug 2023 17:58:22 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://heathhenley.dev/posts/django-postgis-cloud-run-gh-actions/</guid><description>TL;DR: this a short post about the configuration steps I took to get django running with the GDAL extension and postgreSQL/postGIS backend. These notes are what it took to get it deployed on GCP Cloud Run, and to use Github Actions to run automated tests on push or pull request. Pretty straight forward, but I had to iterate a few times to get it right so hopefully this helps someone else.</description></item></channel></rss>
