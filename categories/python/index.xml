These are my (not so) random notes and takeaways from them.
Set 1 - Basics This was pretty quick and easy set to go through, but I&amp;rsquo;m glad I didn&amp;rsquo;t skip it. It introduced &amp;lsquo;repeating key XOR&amp;rsquo; and how to break some cyphers &amp;lsquo;statistically&amp;rsquo; using letter frequency. The most interesting part of the set was Breaking repeating key XOR and solution</description></item><item><title>Random Notes About Python's Random Module</title><link>https://heathhenley.github.io/posts/python-random-module-random-notes/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Dec 2023 12:10:44 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://heathhenley.github.io/posts/python-random-module-random-notes/</guid><description>TL;DR: Use the functions in the random module for modeling, simulations, games, sampling, etc. but use os.urandom, secrets, or random.SystemRandom for cryptographic applications. I know very little about cryptography and security, these are just my notes about stuff I recently learned.
It uses the Mersenne Twister algorithm, which is a pseudorandom number generator with a period of 2^19937-1. It is one of the most widely used PRNGs in the world, and suitable for many applications.</description></item><item><title>Update Github Profile Readme Dynamically using a Github Workflow</title><link>https://heathhenley.github.io/posts/update-gh-readme-with-action/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Aug 2023 20:44:26 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://heathhenley.github.io/posts/update-gh-readme-with-action/</guid><description>TL;DR: Update your Github Profile Readme dynamically with recent blog posts. There&amp;rsquo;s an example (profile and code).
Github Profile Readme Github introduced the option to a add profile readme, which is a special repository that is used to display a readme on your profile page. I wanted to post links to my recent blog posts there, so I wrote a simple python script to check for the latest X posts, and update the readme with links to them.</description></item></channel></rss>
