They&amp;rsquo;ll mostly be about product development, software engineering, or other tech stuff (GIS related probably).
Podcasts Takeaways and notes from recent podcasts I&amp;rsquo;ve listened to - I&amp;rsquo;m finding that taking actual notes is helping me retain info and more actively listen lately - and I figured why not share publicly in case it gets someone else interested in listening to (or not) the episode.</description></item><item><title>Podcasts I've been into lately</title><link>https://heathhenley.dev/posts/podcasts/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Oct 2024 08:11:51 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://heathhenley.dev/posts/podcasts/</guid><description>Here are some podcasts I&amp;rsquo;ve been into lately and why I like them.
Note - I&amp;rsquo;m not affiliated with any of these podcasts, I&amp;rsquo;m just a listener.
Tech Backend Banter - Lane from boot.dev interviews a variety of other devs (mostly) and talks about their experiences and projects. I particularly like that it&amp;rsquo;s not only Golang focused. It&amp;rsquo;s mostly entertainment, but I&amp;rsquo;ve learned a few things from it. I really enjoyed the episodes with John Crickett about &amp;lsquo;mechanical sympathy&amp;rsquo; (and also his coding challenges) and the one with Thomas Ballinger about convex.</description></item></channel></rss>
