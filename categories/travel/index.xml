If I go again, I&amp;rsquo;ll update this list!
TL;DR Mallorca is great! My favorite place is Sineu because it&amp;rsquo;s small and quiet but still has a couple restaurants, bars, a brewery, wineshop and beautiful old town. My favorite hike was the Deia loop and stopping at Cala Deia for beach time.</description></item></channel></rss>
